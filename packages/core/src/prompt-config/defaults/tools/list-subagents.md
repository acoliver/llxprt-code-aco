## Tool: list_subagents

Use this tool to enumerate all configured subagents that are available in the current workspace. It returns their names, associated profiles, and a short description so you can decide which helper to launch.

- Call it when you need to know what specialized subagents exist.
- Do **not** invent subagent names; always rely on the tool output.
- After reading the tool result, decide whether another request (for example, launching a subagent with the `task` tool) is necessary.
