# Phase 02a: Pseudocode Verification

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20251023-STATELESS-HARDENING.P02a`

## Prerequisites
- Required: `.completed/P02.md` exists with pseudocode updates.
- Verification: `test -f project-plans/20251023stateless4/.completed/P02.md`
- Expected files from previous phase: Updated pseudocode documents.

## Implementation Tasks

### Files to Modify
- `project-plans/20251023stateless4/analysis/verification/*.md`
  - Insert cross-check notes confirming pseudocode line coverage.

### Activities
- Review pseudocode to ensure no reliance on removed globals or caches.
- Document mapping table of pseudocode line ranges â†” requirements for later reference.

### Required Code Markers
- Add statements referencing `@plan:PLAN-20251023-STATELESS-HARDENING.P02` within verification notes where needed.

## Verification Commands

### Automated Checks
```bash
# Confirm each pseudocode file lists requirement references
for req in {001..005}; do rg "REQ-SP4-$req" project-plans/20251023stateless4/analysis/pseudocode || exit 1; done
```

### Manual Verification Checklist
- [ ] Every pseudocode file lists targeted implementation phase numbers.
- [ ] All requirements appear in at least one pseudocode step.
- [ ] No lingering references to `getSettingsService()` fallback.

## Success Criteria
- Pseudocode artifacts verified and ready for stub/TDD phases.

## Failure Recovery
1. Update pseudocode to reference missing requirements.
2. Document corrections in verification notes and rerun automated check.

## Phase Completion Marker
- Create `.completed/P02a.md` with verification evidence.
