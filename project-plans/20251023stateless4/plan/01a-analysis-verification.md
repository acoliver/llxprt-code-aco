# Phase 01a: Analysis Verification

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20251023-STATELESS-HARDENING.P01a`

## Prerequisites
- Required: Phase 01 deliverables drafted.
- Verification: `test -f project-plans/20251023stateless4/.completed/P01.md`
- Expected files from previous phase: Updated analysis docs and pseudocode notes.

## Implementation Tasks

### Files to Modify
- `project-plans/20251023stateless4/analysis/verification/*.md`
  - Document review findings, mark TODOs resolved, reference applicable requirements.
- `project-plans/20251023stateless4/analysis/domain-model.md`
  - Apply corrections identified during verification.

### Activities
- Cross-check that every requirement REQ-SP4-001..005 appears in analysis coverage.
- Validate assumptions against source code sections cited in docs.

### Required Code Markers
- Verification notes must reference future markers `@plan:PLAN-20251023-STATELESS-HARDENING.P01` where applicable.

## Verification Commands

### Automated Checks
```bash
# Ensure every requirement referenced at least once
for req in {001..005}; do rg "REQ-SP4-$req" project-plans/20251023stateless4/analysis || exit 1; done
```

### Manual Verification Checklist
- [ ] Domain model aligns with actual code behaviour.
- [ ] No missing requirement mapping.
- [ ] All high-risk areas flagged for pseudocode design.

## Success Criteria
- Verification confirms readiness to proceed to pseudocode with no analysis gaps.

## Failure Recovery
1. Update analysis documents to close verification discrepancies.
2. Re-run requirement coverage loop.

## Phase Completion Marker
- Create `.completed/P01a.md` with verification command outputs.
