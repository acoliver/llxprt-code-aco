# Phase 05a: BaseProvider Implementation Verification

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20251023-STATELESS-HARDENING.P05a`

## Prerequisites
- Required: `.completed/P05.md` with passing guard tests.
- Verification: `test -f project-plans/20251023stateless4/.completed/P05.md`
- Expected files from previous phase: Updated BaseProvider, ProviderManager, error definitions, passing tests.

## Implementation Tasks

### Files to Modify
- `project-plans/20251023stateless4/analysis/verification/base-provider-fallback-removal.md`
  - Append verification results, quoting guard enforcement tests.
- `packages/core/src/providers/__tests__/BaseProvider.guard.test.ts`
  - Add assertions checking error message contents and metadata.

### Activities
- Review diff to confirm pseudocode lines 10-14 fully implemented and referenced in comments.
- Run static analysis or type checking to ensure no unused imports.

### Required Code Markers
- Verification notes should cite `@plan:PLAN-20251023-STATELESS-HARDENING.P05` and `@requirement:REQ-SP4-001`.

## Verification Commands

### Automated Checks
```bash
pnpm test --filter "BaseProvider runtime guard" --runInBand
pnpm lint providers --filter BaseProvider
```

### Manual Verification Checklist
- [ ] Guard tests pass without flakiness.
- [ ] Implementation references pseudocode line ranges in docblocks.
- [ ] No residual singleton fallback calls in BaseProvider.

## Success Criteria
- BaseProvider guard implementation validated and documented.

## Failure Recovery
1. If lint/test fail, fix underlying implementation and rerun verification.
2. Update comments to maintain pseudocode traceability.

## Phase Completion Marker
- Create `.completed/P05a.md` including timestamp, verification logs, and reviewer notes per PLAN-TEMPLATE guidelines.
