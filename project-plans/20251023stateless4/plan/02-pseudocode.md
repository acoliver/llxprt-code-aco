# Phase 02: Cross-Cutting Pseudocode

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20251023-STATELESS-HARDENING.P02`

## Prerequisites
- Required: `.completed/P01a.md` present.
- Verification: `test -f project-plans/20251023stateless4/.completed/P01a.md`
- Expected files from previous phase: Finalised analysis docs.

## Implementation Tasks

### Files to Modify
- `project-plans/20251023stateless4/analysis/pseudocode/base-provider-fallback-removal.md`
  - Expand numbered steps with validation and error messaging specifics covering REQ-SP4-001.
- `project-plans/20251023stateless4/analysis/pseudocode/provider-runtime-handling.md`
  - Detail normalization inputs/outputs and state clearing logic for REQ-SP4-002 & REQ-SP4-003.
- `project-plans/20251023stateless4/analysis/pseudocode/logging-wrapper-adjustments.md`
  - Include runtime context push/pop steps tied to REQ-SP4-004.
- `project-plans/20251023stateless4/analysis/pseudocode/provider-cache-elimination.md`
  - Specify per-provider adjustments and rejection of shared caches.

### Activities
- Ensure all pseudocode steps are line-numbered and will be referenced in downstream phases.
- Annotate each pseudocode block with explicit requirement references and placeholders for `@plan:PLAN-20251023-STATELESS-HARDENING.PNN` markers.
- Identify additional pseudocode files if gaps exist (e.g., CLI verification flows).

### Required Code Markers
- Embed textual references such as `(@plan:PLAN-20251023-STATELESS-HARDENING.P05)` within pseudocode to support later traceability.

## Verification Commands

### Automated Checks
```bash
# Confirm pseudocode includes plan identifiers
rg "PLAN-20251023-STATELESS-HARDENING" project-plans/20251023stateless4/analysis/pseudocode
```

### Manual Verification Checklist
- [ ] Steps numbered sequentially for citation.
- [ ] Requirements mapped per pseudocode section.
- [ ] Edge cases (missing settings, cached model bleed, runtime swap) represented.

## Success Criteria
- Pseudocode provides executable blueprint for implementation phases with clear traceability.

## Failure Recovery
1. Update pseudocode with missing flows or markers.
2. Rerun `rg` command to ensure plan IDs present.

## Phase Completion Marker
- Create `.completed/P02.md` documenting pseudocode readiness.
