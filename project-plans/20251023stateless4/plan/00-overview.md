# Phase 00: Plan Overview

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20251023-STATELESS-HARDENING.P00`

## Prerequisites
- Required: Review `specification.md`, `analysis/domain-model.md`, and overview context.
- Verification: Confirm required source files were inspected (per task instructions).
- Expected files from previous phase: N/A (initial phase).

## Implementation Tasks

### Objectives
- Outline the sequencing for phases P01–P10 covering analysis, pseudocode, stubs, TDD, implementation, integration, migration, and deprecation.
- Map requirements to phases ensuring coverage of REQ-SP4-001 through REQ-SP4-005.
- Document high-level risk mitigation (provider regressions, CLI runtime isolation failures).

### Required Code Markers
- Subsequent phases must add `@plan:PLAN-20251023-STATELESS-HARDENING.PNN` and `@requirement:REQ-SP4-00X` markers to production code per PLAN.md.

## Phase Sequencing
| Phase | Focus | Verification |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| P00 | Plan overview and orchestration context | P00a – Overview verification |
| P01 | Deep-dive analysis of stateless-provider constraints | P01a – Analysis verification |
| P02 | Pseudocode for provider/runtime adjustments | P02a – Pseudocode verification |
| P03 | Provider/runtime scaffolding stubs | P03a – Stub verification |
| P04 | Provider/runtime TDD harness for stateless enforcement | P04a – TDD verification |
| P05 | Base provider implementation updates (AsyncLocalStorage, guard rails) | P05a – Implementation verification |
| P06 | Integration stubs for concrete providers and manager wiring | P06a – Integration stub verification |
| P07 | Integration TDD across providers, logging wrapper, and manager | P07a – Integration TDD verification |
| P08 | Integration implementation for provider fleet and logging wrapper | P08a – Integration implementation verification |
| P09 | Migration cleanup and test hardening across runtimes | P09a – Migration verification |
| P10 | Deprecation and communication activities | P10a – Deprecation verification |

## Requirement Mapping
| Requirement | Covered Phases | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| REQ-SP4-001 | P04, P05 | BaseProvider guards introduced via TDD (P04) and implemented in provider core (P05). |
| REQ-SP4-002 | P06, P07, P08 | Provider stubs drop caches (P06), integration tests enforce stateless calls (P07), and implementations finish removal (P08). |
| REQ-SP4-003 | P05, P07, P08 | Call-scoped config propagation codified in BaseProvider (P05) and validated/implemented within integration phases (P07–P08). |
| REQ-SP4-004 | P07, P08 | LoggingProviderWrapper/ProviderManager rewired and tested statelessly during integration work. |
| REQ-SP4-005 | P07, P09 | Multi-runtime isolation tests added/refined (P07) and regression cleanup performed during migration (P09). |

## Marker Guidance
- All downstream files must retain the colon-prefixed markers exactly as `@plan:PLAN-20251023-STATELESS-HARDENING.PNN`.
- Requirement coverage must cite the appropriate `@requirement:REQ-SP4-00X` identifier(s) alongside plan markers when implementing or verifying tasks.

## Verification Commands

### Automated Checks
```bash
# No commands for overview phase
```

### Manual Verification Checklist
- [ ] Stakeholders agree on phase sequence and responsibilities.
- [ ] All requirements mapped to downstream phases.
- [ ] Risks and mitigations captured.

## Success Criteria
- Overview reflects complete phase list with verification counterparts (P0Xa) and references to requirements.

## Failure Recovery
1. Revisit `specification.md` and adjust requirement mapping.
2. Update overview to match intended phase order before proceeding to P01.

## Phase Completion Marker
- Create `.completed/P00.md` when phase closes, following PLAN-TEMPLATE instructions.
