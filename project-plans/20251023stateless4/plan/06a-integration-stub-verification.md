# Phase 06a: Integration Stub Verification

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20251023-STATELESS-HARDENING.P06a`

## Prerequisites
- Required: `.completed/P06.md` created.
- Verification: `test -f project-plans/20251023stateless4/.completed/P06.md`
- Expected files from previous phase: Stub helpers guarded with `NotYetImplementedError` and plan markers.

## Implementation Tasks

### Activities
- Inspect ProviderManager and LoggingProviderWrapper diffs to ensure the stub helpers only log plan markers and throw `NotYetImplementedError` when invoked.
- Review CLI runtime wiring to confirm the new helper calls are wrapped in feature guards and do not alter current execution paths.
- Capture notes explaining how the stubs will be replaced during P07 (`@plan:PLAN-20251023-STATELESS-HARDENING.P07` references).

### Required Code Markers
- Verification notes must cite `@plan:PLAN-20251023-STATELESS-HARDENING.P06` and the relevant `@requirement:REQ-SP4-004` / `@requirement:REQ-SP4-005` IDs.

## Verification Commands

### Automated Checks
```bash
pnpm lint providers --filter ProviderManager
pnpm lint cli --filter runtime
```

### Manual Verification Checklist
- [ ] Stubs throw `NotYetImplementedError` with plan identifiers.
- [ ] CLI runtime helpers no-op when stateless mode is disabled.
- [ ] No existing tests deviate from previous behaviour.

## Success Criteria
- Stub infrastructure is documented and behaves inertly, ready for integration TDD.

## Failure Recovery
1. If regression detected, revert the stub sections and restage with guarded helper functions.
2. Update documentation to clarify stub purpose before moving forward.

## Phase Completion Marker
- Create `.completed/P06a.md` with timestamp, lint output, and inspection notes per PLAN-TEMPLATE guidelines.
