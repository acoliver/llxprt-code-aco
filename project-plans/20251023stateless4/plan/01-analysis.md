# Phase 01: Deep-Dive Analysis

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20251023-STATELESS-HARDENING.P01`

## Prerequisites
- Required: Phase 00 completed and `.completed/P00.md` recorded.
- Verification: `test -f project-plans/20251023stateless4/.completed/P00.md`
- Expected files from previous phase: `specification.md`, `analysis/domain-model.md` (initial draft).

## Implementation Tasks

### Files to Modify
- `project-plans/20251023stateless4/analysis/domain-model.md`
  - Enrich runtime/provider interaction map with failing scenarios tied to REQ-SP4-001/002/003.
- `project-plans/20251023stateless4/analysis/verification/*.md`
  - Add detailed acceptance signals discovered during log review.
- `project-plans/20251023stateless4/analysis/pseudocode/*.md`
  - Annotate with assumptions or open questions discovered in analysis (no code yet).

### Activities
- Run targeted code spelunking for each provider to document current caches, singleton calls, and constructor-captured state.
- Record risk matrix (fallback removal, OAuth edge cases, CLI registry regression) inside analysis docs referencing `@requirement:REQ-SP4-001`..`@requirement:REQ-SP4-005`.
- Capture sample call flows demonstrating failure when settings omitted; link to BaseProvider lines.

### Required Code Markers
- When updating code during later phases, ensure every addition includes `@plan:PLAN-20251023-STATELESS-HARDENING.PNN` and a matching `@requirement:REQ-SP4-00X` tag. (Reminder for future phases.)

## Verification Commands

### Automated Checks
```bash
# Ensure analysis documents updated
rg "REQ-SP4" project-plans/20251023stateless4/analysis
```

### Manual Verification Checklist
- [ ] Domain model lists every provider touchpoint affected by REQ-SP4-00X.
- [ ] Risks and mitigations enumerated for OAuth, runtime isolation, and logging wrapper.
- [ ] Open questions captured for resolution in Phase 02.

## Success Criteria
- Comprehensive written analysis aligning requirements with current gaps.
- Clear blockers and assumptions documented for pseudocode phase.

## Failure Recovery
1. Re-review provider source files to close identified knowledge gaps.
2. Update analysis docs with missing flows, then rerun verification.

## Phase Completion Marker
- Create `.completed/P01.md` capturing updated documents and analysis outcomes.
