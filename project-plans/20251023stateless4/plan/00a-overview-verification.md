# Phase 00a: Overview Verification

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20251023-STATELESS-HARDENING.P00a`

## Prerequisites
- Required: Phase 00 overview drafted and stakeholder feedback captured.
- Verification: `test -f project-plans/20251023stateless4/.completed/P00.md`
- Expected files from previous phase: `project-plans/20251023stateless4/plan/00-overview.md`, `project-plans/20251023stateless4/specification.md`, `project-plans/20251023stateless4/analysis/domain-model.md`.

## Implementation Tasks

### Files to Modify
- `project-plans/20251023stateless4/plan/00-overview.md`
  - Apply clarifications uncovered during verification (phase sequencing, requirement mapping).
- `project-plans/20251023stateless4/execution-tracker.md`
  - Initialize tracker entries for P00/P00a after verification completes.

### Activities
- Confirm every requirement REQ-SP4-001..005 is mapped to at least one downstream phase.
- Validate each phase has a matching verification counterpart (P00 <-> P00a, ..., P10 <-> P10a).
- Ensure overview directives enforce `@plan:PLAN-20251023-STATELESS-HARDENING.PNN` and `@requirement:REQ-SP4-00X` markers.

### Required Code Markers
- Verification notes must reference `@plan:PLAN-20251023-STATELESS-HARDENING.P00` and cite associated `@requirement:REQ-SP4-00X` mappings when logging outcomes.

## Verification Commands

### Automated Checks
```bash
rg "@plan:PLAN-20251023-STATELESS-HARDENING" project-plans/20251023stateless4/plan/00-overview.md
rg "REQ-SP4-00[1-5]" project-plans/20251023stateless4/plan/00-overview.md
```

### Manual Verification Checklist
- [ ] Requirement to phase mapping is explicit and complete.
- [ ] Execution tracker reflects overview/verification phases.
- [ ] Overview highlights colon-prefixed marker requirements.

## Success Criteria
- Overview confirmed accurate, traceable, and ready for downstream execution.

## Failure Recovery
1. Update overview content to correct missing requirements or marker guidance.
2. Re-run automated checks to validate colon-prefixed markers and requirement references.

## Phase Completion Marker
- Create `.completed/P00a.md` containing verification notes and command output summaries.
