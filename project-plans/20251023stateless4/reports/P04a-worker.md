# Phase P04a – TDD Verification Log

## Commands
- `pnpm test --filter "runtime guard" --runInBand && exit 1` → exits with `CACError: Unknown option --filter`, preventing vitest from executing runtime guard suites across all workspaces.

## Findings
- Added inline annotations to `packages/core/src/providers/__tests__/BaseProvider.guard.test.ts` capturing the blocked red state and mapping to pseudocode lines 10-16 for @plan:PLAN-20251023-STATELESS-HARDENING.P04 coverage.
- Verification note updated in `analysis/verification/base-provider-fallback-removal.md` to document the command failure and reaffirm unmet obligations for @requirement:REQ-SP4-001, @requirement:REQ-SP4-004, and @requirement:REQ-SP4-005.

## Checklist Outcomes
- All added tests still red – Blocked by vitest rejecting `--filter`; expectations remain unverified.
- Failure messages align with missing runtime context expectations – Blocked pending command compatibility.
- No accidental fixes or regressions observed – Confirmed; verification introduced documentation-only changes.
