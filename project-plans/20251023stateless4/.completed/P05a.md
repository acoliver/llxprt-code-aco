# Phase P05a Completion

- Started: 2025-10-23T22:26:45Z
- Finished: 2025-10-23T22:27:45Z

## Summary
- Re-ran guard-focused suites (BaseProvider, ProviderManager integration, stateless provider suites, CLI runtime) to confirm the new runtime guard behaviour passes across providers and CLI wiring.
- Recorded verification notes linking to pseudocode and removed fallback references; lint/typecheck/build executed cleanly.
