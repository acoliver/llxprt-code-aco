### Summary
- Verified overview sequencing covers P00–P10 and paired verification phases, adding explicit table to `plan/00-overview.md`.
- Documented requirement coverage for REQ-SP4-001..005 and reinforced marker syntax guidance.
- Updated execution tracker to note P00 completion and P00a verification timestamps.

### Commands
- PASS `test -f project-plans/20251023stateless4/.completed/P00.md`
- PASS `rg "@plan:PLAN-20251023-STATELESS-HARDENING" project-plans/20251023stateless4/plan/00-overview.md`
- PASS `rg "REQ-SP4-00[1-5]" project-plans/20251023stateless4/plan/00-overview.md`

### Verification Command Output
```plaintext
$ rg "@plan:PLAN-20251023-STATELESS-HARDENING" project-plans/20251023stateless4/plan/00-overview.md
- Subsequent phases must add `@plan:PLAN-20251023-STATELESS-HARDENING.PNN` and `@requirement:REQ-SP4-00X` markers to production code per PLAN.md.
- All downstream files must retain the colon-prefixed markers exactly as `@plan:PLAN-20251023-STATELESS-HARDENING.PNN`.

$ rg "REQ-SP4-00[1-5]" project-plans/20251023stateless4/plan/00-overview.md
- Map requirements to phases ensuring coverage of REQ-SP4-001 through REQ-SP4-005.
| REQ-SP4-001 | P04, P05 | BaseProvider guards introduced via TDD (P04) and implemented in provider core (P05). |
| REQ-SP4-002 | P06, P07, P08 | Provider stubs drop caches (P06), integration tests enforce stateless calls (P07), and implementations finish removal (P08). |
| REQ-SP4-003 | P05, P07, P08 | Call-scoped config propagation codified in BaseProvider (P05) and validated/implemented within integration phases (P07–P08). |
| REQ-SP4-004 | P07, P08 | LoggingProviderWrapper/ProviderManager rewired and tested statelessly during integration work. |
| REQ-SP4-005 | P07, P09 | Multi-runtime isolation tests added/refined (P07) and regression cleanup performed during migration (P09). |
