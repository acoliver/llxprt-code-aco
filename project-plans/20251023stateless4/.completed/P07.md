# PLAN-20251023-STATELESS-HARDENING · Phase P07 Completion

- Started: 2025-10-24T13:40:48Z
- Finished: 2025-10-24T14:05:00Z
- Outcome: RED stateless integration coverage added across providers, logging wrapper, and CLI runtimes; Vitest `--filter` flag remains unsupported, leaving verification commands failing as expected.

## Summary
- Added call-scoped user memory/config expectations to Anthropic, Gemini, OpenAI, and OpenAI Responses stateless suites.
- Introduced a stateless hardening guard test for `LoggingProviderWrapper` to require per-call configuration.
- Extended CLI `runtimeIsolation` and `profileApplication` tests to surface missing stateless guard wiring under `LLXPRT_STATELESS_HARDENING`.

## Verification Output
```
pnpm test --filter "stateless" --runInBand || true
 WARN  Issue while reading ".npmrc" …
CACError: Unknown option `--filter`
```
