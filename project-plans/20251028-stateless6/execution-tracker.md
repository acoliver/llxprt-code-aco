## Requirements Coverage

- REQ-STAT6-001 – SubAgentScope and GeminiChat operate exclusively on an injected runtime view (no Config mutation/access).
- REQ-STAT6-002 – Runtime view encapsulates immutable provider/model/auth/modelParams/ephemeral data required for API calls.
- REQ-STAT6-003 – Independent runtime views operate concurrently with isolated history/settings/telemetry.

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] All code/test artifacts tagged with `@plan` and `@requirement`.
- [ ] Each phase has corresponding `.completed/Pxx.md`.
- [ ] Pseudocode referenced by implementation/tests.
- [ ] Final verification includes lint, typecheck, tests, mutation/property where applicable.
