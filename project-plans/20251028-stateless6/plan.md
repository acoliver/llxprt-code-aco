# Plan: GeminiChat Stateless Runtime View

Plan ID: PLAN-20251028-STATELESS6  
Generated: 2025-10-28  
Total Phases: 22 (11 execution phases + 11 verification phases)  
Requirements: REQ-STAT6-001, REQ-STAT6-002, REQ-STAT6-003

| Phase | Title | Summary |
|-------|-------|---------|
| P02 | Architectural Specification | Capture design decisions, glossary, and evaluation checklist driving STATELESS6. |
| P02a | Specification Verification | Confirm specification completeness and stakeholder sign-off. |
| P03 | Architecture Analysis | Inventory every Config/Settings/ProviderManager dependency in GeminiChat/SubAgentScope. |
| P03a | Analysis Verification | Validate analysis completeness per PLAN checklist. |
| P04 | Requirements & Test Strategy | Define requirements and behavioural test plan for stateless runtime view. |
| P04a | Requirements Verification | Confirm requirement coverage and traceability. |
| P05 | Pseudocode: Runtime View | Produce detailed pseudocode for GeminiChatRuntimeView injection. |
| P05a | Pseudocode Verification | Verify pseudocode completeness vs. analysis requirements. |
| P06 | Stub Implementation | Introduce `GeminiRuntimeView` interface and adapter while preserving behaviour. |
| P06a | Stub Verification | Confirm stub phase maintains green build and markers. |
| P07 | Unit TDD – SubAgentScope | Add failing unit specs preventing Config mutation (e.g., `setModel`). |
| P07a | Unit TDD Verification | Document expected failures and coverage. |
| P08 | Unit Implementation – SubAgentScope | Remove Config mutation, adopt runtime view in SubAgentScope. |
| P08a | Unit Implementation Verification | Validate tests, lint, and pseudocode adherence. |
| P09 | Integration TDD – Ephemeral/Telemetry | Add failing integration test ensuring injected view carries ephemerals/telemetry without Config. |
| P09a | Integration TDD Verification | Verify failure demonstrates remaining dependencies. |
| P10 | Integration Implementation – GeminiChat | Extend runtime view with ephemerals/headers, refactor GeminiChat telemetry/tool access. |
| P10a | Integration Implementation Verification | Final verification: tests, lint, mutation/property, pseudocode compliance. |
| P11 | Integration Hardening | Audit repository for residual Config references and update integration map/specification. |
| P11a | Integration Hardening Verification | Confirm only runtime view APIs remain via targeted greps. |
| P12 | Migration & Plan Evaluation | Document migration notes, run plan evaluation subagent, update docs/tooling. |
| P12a | Migration Verification | Record evaluation outputs and ensure documentation reflects new architecture. |

All phases must be executed sequentially with markers: `@plan PLAN-20251028-STATELESS6.PNN` and `@requirement` tags in code and tests. Verification phases capture commands and outputs listed in `dev-docs/PLAN.md`.
