    "HIGH: Expand pseudocode with more algorithmic detail for complex steps (e.g., 005.4 telemetry enrichment logic)",
    "HIGH: Create specific integration test scenario in test strategy showing exact foreground/subagent setup and assertions",

  "summary": "PLAN-20251028-STATELESS6 demonstrates STRONG INTEGRATION PLANNING and correctly avoids the 'isolated feature trap'. The plan identifies specific existing files to modify (geminiChat.ts, subagent.ts), lists exact code to remove (setModel mutation at line 609), and shows integration pathways through Config adapter bridge. Phases are properly sequenced (TDD before implementation) with verification steps. HOWEVER, the plan suffers from EXECUTION GAPS: (1) test strategy is too abstract/vague with no concrete test case code, (2) implementation phases don't granularly reference pseudocode line numbers, (3) verification phases lack pseudocode compliance checking and marker verification. The DEEP-ANALYSIS.md file explicitly marks this plan as 'NOT READY TO EXECUTE' and identifies missing details. While the plan structure and integration approach are correct, it needs MORE SPECIFICITY in test cases, pseudocode references, and verification steps before execution can proceed safely. Status: CONDITIONALLY ACCEPTABLE pending specificity improvements."
