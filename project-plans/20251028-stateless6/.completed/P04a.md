## Gap Analysis

### Coverage Gaps
**NONE IDENTIFIED** - All 9 sub-requirements have at least one test case.

### Property-Based Test Coverage Gap
**IDENTIFIED** - Current coverage: 10.9%, Target: ≥30%

**Current Property Tests** (6):
1. Round-trip compression thresholds (REQ-STAT6-002.2)
2. Context limits round-trip (REQ-STAT6-002.2)
3. Telemetry enrichment properties (REQ-STAT6-002.3)
4. Immutability verification (REQ-STAT6-001.3)
5. Runtime ID uniqueness (REQ-STAT6-003.3)
6. Metadata always includes state fields (REQ-STAT6-002.3)

**Gap**: Need **11 additional property tests** in P06-P08 to reach 30% (17/55 tests)

**Suggested Additional Property Tests**:
1. Ephemeral setting defaults for all threshold types (REQ-STAT6-002.2)
2. Provider adapter immutability under mutation attempts (REQ-STAT6-001.3)
3. Settings adapter read-only properties (REQ-STAT6-001.3)
4. Tool adapter name queries with arbitrary tool sets (REQ-STAT6-001.2)
5. Telemetry metadata enrichment for arbitrary state combinations (REQ-STAT6-002.3)
6. Runtime context factory with arbitrary input combinations (REQ-STAT6-001.1)
7. Subagent profile to runtime context mappings (REQ-STAT6-001.1)
8. Concurrent runtime context creation (REQ-STAT6-003.1)
9. History service independence under concurrent modifications (REQ-STAT6-003.2)
10. Compression threshold edge cases (0.0, 1.0) (REQ-STAT6-002.2)
11. Maximum output tokens clamping behavior (REQ-STAT6-002.2)

### Mutation Testing Coverage
**ADEQUATE** - 11 mutation tests targeting critical paths (20% of total tests)

Critical mutations identified:
1. `Object.freeze()` removal (factory, state)
2. Ephemeral default value changes
3. Telemetry enrichment removal
4. Config mutation spy removal
5. Regression guard deletion

Expected kill rate: ≥80% on critical paths

### Test Distribution Analysis
**BALANCED** - Test types distributed appropriately:
- Unit tests (28): 50.9% - covers adapter interfaces, factory functions
- Integration tests (10): 18.2% - covers end-to-end isolation, concurrency
- Property tests (6): 10.9% - needs expansion to 30%
- Mutation tests (11): 20.0% - adequate for critical path verification

✓ All 9 sub-requirements have test cases listed

### Phase Mapping Validated
- **P06 (Scaffold)**: 5 requirements → 11 unit tests
- **P07 (SubAgentScope)**: 3 requirements → 8 unit tests
- **P08 (GeminiChat)**: 4 requirements → 9 unit tests

## Overall Verification Result

**STATUS: PASS**

### Strengths
1. **Complete Requirements Coverage**: All 9 sub-requirements have test cases
2. **Comprehensive Test Strategy**: 55 tests across 4 test types
3. **Strong Traceability**: Every test case annotated with `@requirement` and `@plan` markers
4. **Critical Path Focus**: Spy-based mutation guards for line 609 regression risk
5. **Mutation Testing Plan**: 11 mutation tests targeting immutability enforcement

### Identified Gaps
1. **Property-Based Test Coverage**: 10.9% vs. 30% target (need 11 more tests)
   - **Remediation Plan**: Add property tests in P06-P08 phases
   - **Priority**: Medium (coverage target, not functional gap)

### Recommendations for Phase P05
1. Add 11 property tests during P06-P08 implementation to reach 30% target
2. Prioritize property tests for:
   - Ephemeral settings edge cases (REQ-STAT6-002.2)
   - Adapter immutability (REQ-STAT6-001.3)
   - Concurrent runtime context creation (REQ-STAT6-003.1)
3. Ensure all new tests include `@plan` and `@requirement` annotations
4. Run mutation testing in P10 to validate ≥80% kill rate

### Next Phase
Proceed to **Phase P05** (Pseudocode) per plan.md.
