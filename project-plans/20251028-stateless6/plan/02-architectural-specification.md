# Phase P02: Architectural Specification

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20251028-STATELESS6.P02`

## Prerequisites
- None (first execution phase)

## Objectives
- Summarise STATELESS5 outcomes and motivate STATELESS6 scope.
- Document glossary, invariants, and dependency map consumed by later phases.
- Produce evaluation checklist ensuring plan requirements (REQ-STAT6-001..003) are feasible.

## Deliverables
- Update `analysis/architecture.md` with background context and glossary entries.
- Create `plan/specification.md` detailing decisions, scope exclusions, and acceptance criteria.
- Record evaluation checklist in `plan/specification.md#Evaluation`.

## Required Markers
- Include `@plan PLAN-20251028-STATELESS6.P02` in new specification document sections.
- Cross-reference requirements by ID.

## Completion Criteria
1. Specification document committed with rationale, glossary, and evaluation table.
2. Analysis file references STATELESS5 runtime state and outstanding dependencies.
3. Stakeholder sign-off captured in specification (self-approval acceptable for now).

## Verification Inputs for P02a
- `git diff --stat` showing updates only to specification artifacts.
- Manual checklist ensuring deliverables satisfied.
