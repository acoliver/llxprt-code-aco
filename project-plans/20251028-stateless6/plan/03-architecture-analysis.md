# Phase P03: Architecture Analysis

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20251028-STATELESS6.P03`

## Prerequisites
- P02 / P02a completed and verified

## Objectives
- Catalogue every remaining Config/Settings/ProviderManager dependency in GeminiChat/SubAgentScope.
- Identify all mutable operations that violate stateless execution.
- Update `analysis/architecture.md` and `analysis/integration-map.md` with concrete findings.

## Tasks
1. Inspect `packages/core/src/core/geminiChat.ts` and list Config access points (line numbers, method names).
2. Inspect `packages/core/src/core/subagent.ts` for Config mutation patterns (e.g., `setModel`).
3. Document telemetry/tool registry dependencies and history usage.
4. Capture findings in `analysis/architecture.md` with `@plan PLAN-20251028-STATELESS6.P03` annotation.
5. Update `analysis/integration-map.md` table accordingly.

## Required Markers
- All additions include `@plan PLAN-20251028-STATELESS6.P03` and relevant requirement IDs.

## Completion Criteria
- Architecture document includes updated dependency tables and commentary.
- Integration map reflects target runtime view adapters.
- Evidence of analysis recorded for P03a verification.
