# Phase P10: Integration Implementation – GeminiChat

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20251028-STATELESS6.P10`

## Prerequisites
- Phases P09/P09a completed

## Objectives
- Extend runtime view to supply ephemerals/telemetry/providers and refactor GeminiChat accordingly.

## Tasks
1. Implement builder logic per pseudocode steps 005 & 009 (defaults, telemetry enrichment, provider/registry adapters).
2. Refactor GeminiChat to consume runtime view (steps 006.1–006.7).
3. Update telemetry helpers/loggers to accept runtime metadata (may introduce wrapper functions).
4. Ensure integration test from P09 now passes.
5. Update exports and documentation comments accordingly.

## Completion Criteria
- Integration tests pass.
- Requirements REQ-STAT6-001..003 satisfied at integration level.
- Implementation annotated with `@plan PLAN-20251028-STATELESS6.P10` markers.
