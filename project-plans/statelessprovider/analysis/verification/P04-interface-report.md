# P04a Provider Interface Verification Report

@plan:PLAN-20250218-STATELESSPROVIDER.P04a  
@requirement:REQ-SP-001

## Summary
- Validation confirms the options-based provider interface behaves per specification while retaining legacy invocation compatibility.
- Existing provider adapters still rely on `getSettingsService()`; catalogued for transition planning in P05.
- Integration surface aligns with pseudocode artefacts, ensuring traceability for runtime adoption.

## Automated Verification Evidence
- `npm run typecheck` (2025-10-17 21:09:22 UTC) — PASS; no TypeScript diagnostics.
- `npx vitest run packages/core/src/providers/providerInterface.compat.test.ts packages/core/src/providers/BaseProvider.test.ts packages/core/src/providers/integration/multi-provider.integration.test.ts` (2025-10-17 21:09:33 UTC) — PASS; `Multi-Provider Integration Tests` skipped expectedly because `OPENAI_API_KEY` is absent in this environment.

## Manual Verification Checklist
- **Options signature compatibility** — `packages/core/src/providers/providerInterface.compat.test.ts` exercises both positional (`generateChatCompletion([...])`) and options-based invocations, confirming normalization into `NormalizedGenerateChatOptions` matches the behaviour described in `analysis/pseudocode/base-provider.md` and `analysis/pseudocode/provider-invocation.md`.
- **Legacy usage intact** — Legacy calls automatically inject a `SettingsService` instance when no options object is provided, matching prior behaviour verified in `packages/core/src/providers/BaseProvider.test.ts`.
- **Direct `getSettingsService()` imports** — Transition backlog includes `packages/core/src/providers/ProviderManager.ts`, `BaseProvider.ts`, `AnthropicProvider.ts`, `GeminiProvider.ts`, `OpenAIProvider.ts`, and `openai-responses/OpenAIResponsesProvider.ts` (plus corresponding tests) which still pull settings from the singleton accessor.
- **Risk items for P05** — Primary risk is continued singleton settings dependency; additional follow-up needed to supply runtime-scoped settings before broader rollout. Integration test coverage for multi-provider flows depends on `OPENAI_API_KEY`, so secure key provisioning is required to exercise full OAuth path prior to production launch.
- **Pseudocode traceability** — Behaviour is consistent with `project-plans/statelessprovider/analysis/pseudocode/base-provider.md` (initialization flow) and `project-plans/statelessprovider/analysis/pseudocode/provider-invocation.md` (options normalization).

## Conclusion
- Phase P04a verification status: **GO** — Ready to proceed toward core runtime adoption given documented follow-ups.
