## Command Coverage
- `npm run typecheck` → PASS
```text
> @vybestack/llxprt-code@0.4.2 typecheck
> npm run typecheck --workspaces --if-present
> @vybestack/llxprt-code-a2a-server@0.4.2 typecheck
> tsc --noEmit
> @vybestack/llxprt-code@0.4.2 typecheck
> tsc --noEmit
> @vybestack/llxprt-code-core@0.4.2 typecheck
> tsc --noEmit
> @vybestack/llxprt-code-test-utils@0.4.2 typecheck
> tsc --noEmit
```
- `npx vitest run <targeted suites>` → PASS
```text
Test Files  5 passed (5)
Tests       37 passed (37)
Duration    1.60s
Notable stdout: Gemini OAuth ENOENT warnings surfaced but were wrapped by GracefulErrorHandler, matching expected fallback behaviour.
```

## Integration Findings
- Provider configuration helpers (`packages/cli/src/providers/providerConfigUtils.ts`) sanitize input and delegate to runtime settings APIs, removing direct provider mutations and aligning with `cli-runtime.md` pseudocode.
- Zed integration bootstrap (`packages/cli/src/zed-integration/zedIntegration.ts`) registers the runtime context and reapplies profile-derived credentials via `setProviderApiKey` / `setProviderBaseUrl`, ensuring dialogs and Agent sessions stay synchronized with runtime helpers.
- CLI dialogs (`packages/cli/src/ui/hooks/useProviderDialog.ts`, `packages/cli/src/ui/hooks/useLoadProfileDialog.ts`) load state through `runtimeSettings` helpers, avoiding singleton fallbacks while preserving UI messaging / clearing behaviour.
- Auth precedence adapter coverage (`packages/core/src/auth/precedence.adapter.test.ts`) confirms that swapping in injected `SettingsService` instances updates the resolver at runtime, demonstrating the stateless adapter flow.
- Targeted vitest suites validated base URL override propagation, provider switching, and runtime helper sanitization, mirroring workflows exercised in manual smoke paths.

## Remaining Legacy Targets
- `packages/cli/src/providers/providerManagerInstance.ts` still exposes a cached singleton; Phase P08 should consolidate callers onto dependency-injected provider managers to retire this bridge.
- `packages/core/src/config/config.ts` keeps fallback branches for legacy `getProviderManager` access; these paths should be revisited when consolidating runtime context handling in P09.
- `packages/cli/src/validateNonInterActiveAuth.ts` performs defensive provider manager lookups that bypass runtime helper shims; track for conversion once consolidated provider context APIs land.

## Manual Verification Checklist
- [x] Report confirms provider utilities, Zed integration, and dialogs operate through runtime helpers.
- [x] Auth precedence adapter verified with injected settings instance (see vitest results and adapter coverage).
- [x] Remaining legacy APIs identified for P08/P09 follow-up (see above).
- [x] Pseudocode annotations (`@pseudocode:cli-runtime.md`) verified against helper-based implementations in provider config utilities and Zed runtime bootstrap.
