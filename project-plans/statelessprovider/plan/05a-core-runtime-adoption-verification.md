# Phase 05a: Core Runtime Adoption Verification

## Phase ID

`PLAN-20250218-STATELESSPROVIDER.P05a`

## Prerequisites

- Required: Phase 05 completed.
- Verification: `grep -r "PLAN-20250218-STATELESSPROVIDER.P05" packages/core/src/config packages/core/src/providers packages/core/src/core`
- Expected files from previous phase: Updated config, provider manager, prompts, geminiChat, CLI factory, and associated tests.

## Implementation Tasks

### Files to Create

- `project-plans/statelessprovider/analysis/verification/P05-core-report.md`
  - Summarize regression testing, highlight remaining singleton touchpoints, and call out follow-up actions (if any).
  - MUST include: `@plan:PLAN-20250218-STATELESSPROVIDER.P05a`
  - MUST include: `@requirement:REQ-SP-001`

### Required Code Markers

Add plan/requirement annotations within the verification report.

## Verification Commands

```bash
npm run typecheck
npx vitest run packages/core/src/core/geminiChat.runtime.test.ts packages/core/src/providers/providerManager.context.test.ts packages/core/src/providers/BaseProvider.test.ts packages/core/src/providers/integration/multi-provider.integration.test.ts
```

Capture command output and include in the report.

## Manual Verification Checklist

- [ ] Confirm CLI still boots and provider switching works (manual smoke test).
- [ ] Ensure prompt helper no longer reads global settings implicitly.
- [ ] Verify shim/wrapper APIs are documented for eventual removal.
- [ ] List any modules that still require migration in phases P06â€“P07.

## Success Criteria

- Report confirms runtime adoption is stable and ready for CLI/UI migration.

## Failure Recovery

1. Delete the report if issues are discovered.
2. Resolve runtime wiring problems, rerun verification commands, recreate report.

## Phase Completion Marker

Create: `project-plans/statelessprovider/.completed/P05a.md`
