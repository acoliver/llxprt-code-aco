| Phase | Title | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- | ------- |
| P01 | Analysis | Deep dive into current runtime, identify touchpoints |
| P01a | Analysis Verification | Confirm completeness of analysis artifact |
| P02 | Pseudocode & Design | Create required pseudocode artifacts and runtime context design |
| P02a | Pseudocode Verification | Ensure pseudocode meets requirements |
| P03 | Runtime Context Foundation | Introduce injectable runtime context while keeping current APIs functional |
| P03a | Runtime Context Verification | Validate context layer and adapter coverage |
| P04 | Provider Interface Migration | Add compatible `generateChatCompletion` pathway and adapters (no breaking removals yet) |
| P04a | Provider Interface Verification | Confirm interface changes compile and legacy callers still function |
| P05 | Core Runtime Adoption | Move Config, ProviderManager, prompts, geminiChat to injected context without stubbing |
| P05a | Core Runtime Adoption Verification | Verify updated core flow and regression coverage |
| P06 | CLI Command & UI Migration | Update CLI commands/hooks/UI to use runtime helpers instead of provider mutators |
| P06a | CLI Migration Verification | Ensure command flows operate via settings/config helpers |
| P07 | Extended Integration Cleanup | Cover providerConfigUtils, zed integration, load profile dialog, tests, and auth adapter |
| P07a | Extended Integration Verification | Validate secondary surfaces and adapters |
| P08 | Test Suite Consolidation | Update/expand automated coverage, retire mocks relying on setters |
| P08a | Test Suite Verification | Ensure updated suites pass and cover new flows |
| P09 | Legacy API Decommission | Remove deprecated setters/getters and singleton exports after adoption |
| P09a | Decommission Verification | Confirm no legacy paths remain |
| P10 | Documentation & Release | Update docs, release notes, and migration guidance |
| P10a | Documentation Verification | Validate documentation changes |
