# Phase 04a: Provider Interface Verification

## Phase ID

`PLAN-20250218-STATELESSPROVIDER.P04a`

## Prerequisites

- Required: Phase 04 completed.
- Verification: `grep -r "PLAN-20250218-STATELESSPROVIDER.P04" packages/core/src/providers`
- Expected files from previous phase: Updated provider interface, adapter tests, and exports.

## Implementation Tasks

### Files to Create

- `project-plans/statelessprovider/analysis/verification/P04-interface-report.md`
  - Summarize adapter behaviour, confirm dual-signature coverage, and capture any lingering singleton dependencies.
  - MUST include: `@plan:PLAN-20250218-STATELESSPROVIDER.P04a`
  - MUST include: `@requirement:REQ-SP-001`

### Required Code Markers

Include plan/requirement annotations within the verification report.

## Verification Commands

### Automated Checks

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test -- --runTestsByPath packages/core/src/providers/__tests__/providerInterface.compat.test.ts packages/core/src/providers/BaseProvider.test.ts packages/core/src/providers/integration/multi-provider.integration.test.ts
```

### Manual Verification Checklist

- [ ] Report confirms new options-based signature works while legacy usage remains intact.
- [ ] Highlight any modules still importing `getSettingsService()` directly for future phases.
- [ ] Note risk items that must be addressed before core runtime adoption (P05).
- [ ] Reference pseudocode artifacts to maintain traceability.

## Success Criteria

- Verification provides a clear “go” for adopting the new signature across core runtime components.

## Failure Recovery

1. Delete the report if inconsistencies are found.
2. Address adapter/test issues, rerun commands, recreate report.

## Phase Completion Marker

Create: `project-plans/statelessprovider/.completed/P04a.md`
