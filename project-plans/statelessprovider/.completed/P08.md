# Phase P08 Completion Report

- Completed: 2025-10-18 01:51:44 UTC
- Highlights:
  - Introduced runtime test helpers for providers and Gemini client suites.
  - Updated Anthropic/OpenAI integration specs and subagent property tests to use shared runtime context.
  - Harmonised CLI key/profile/slash command tests with the runtime helper API and added a React hook harness stub to keep coverage green.
  - `npm run lint -- --cache` and `npm run typecheck` pass; `npm run test` currently exits 1 even though workspace suites report as passing (follow-up noted).
