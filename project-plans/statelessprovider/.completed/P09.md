# Phase P09 Completion Report

- Completed: 2025-10-18 15:07:15 UTC
- Highlights:
  - Removed remaining CLI/test dependencies on provider mutators by routing `/set` flows, provider switching specs, and new model parameter integrations through runtime helpers and SettingsService.
  - Reworked runtime helper tests and Anthropic provider suites to exercise the stateless settings pipeline, dropping expectations for legacy mutator methods.
  - Refreshed provider manager compatibility helpers and integration tests to align with the `createProviderManager` API while keeping existing mocks green.
  - `npm run lint -- --cache`, `npm run test`, and `npm run typecheck` all pass.
