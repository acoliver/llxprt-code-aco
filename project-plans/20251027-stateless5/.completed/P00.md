# Phase 00 Completion Report

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20251027-STATELESS5.P00`

## Completion Date
2025-10-27

## Objectives Summary
Phase 00 established the foundational planning artifacts for the Stateless Foreground Agent Phase 5 implementation. This phase verified that all planning documentation is in place and accurately scopes the work ahead.

## Finalized Objectives

### 1. Runtime State Abstraction (REQ-STAT5-001)
- Introduce `AgentRuntimeState` to replace Config-centric provider/model/auth data
- Provide immutable accessors/mutators with synchronous change events
- Include diagnostics snapshot capability

### 2. CLI Runtime Helper Integration (REQ-STAT5-002)
- Update slash commands (`/set`, `/provider`, `/model`, `/key`, `/keyfile`, `/profile`) to delegate to runtime state
- Ensure CLI flags (`--set`, `--profile-load`, `--model`, `--key`, `--keyfile`) hydrate runtime state
- Maintain legacy Config mirrors only for UI diagnostics

### 3. GeminiClient Runtime Consumption (REQ-STAT5-003)
- Refactor GeminiClient to read provider/model/auth exclusively from runtime state
- Subscribe to runtime state changes for telemetry context

### 4. GeminiChat Stateless Operation (REQ-STAT5-004)
- Update GeminiChat to use injected runtime state for all provider invocations
- Retain HistoryService as injectable dependency (not singleton)
- Eliminate all Config linkage for provider/model/auth

### 5. Integration & Diagnostics Continuity (REQ-STAT5-005)
- Ensure diagnostics commands source data from runtime state snapshots
- Add regression tests confirming runtime isolation between foreground agent instances
- Update documentation to reflect runtime state usage

## Tracker Initialization
The execution tracker (`execution-tracker.md`) has been verified to contain:
- All 26 phases (13 implementation + 13 verification phases) enumerated sequentially
- Status tracking structure for each phase
- Completion marker checklist for plan-level validation

## Verification Results

### Automated Checks
✓ `overview.md` exists and is accessible
✓ `specification.md` exists and is accessible
✓ `execution-tracker.md` references PLAN-20251027-STATELESS5

### Manual Verification
✓ Overview documents objectives aligning with REQ-STAT5-001..005
✓ Specification lists formal requirements, architectural decisions, and verification strategy
✓ Execution tracker enumerates all phases (P00-P12a) including verification phases sequentially

## Artifacts Created
- `/Users/acoliver/projects/llxprt-code/project-plans/20251027-stateless5/.completed/P00.md` (this file)

## Artifacts Verified
- `/Users/acoliver/projects/llxprt-code/project-plans/20251027-stateless5/overview.md`
- `/Users/acoliver/projects/llxprt-code/project-plans/20251027-stateless5/specification.md`
- `/Users/acoliver/projects/llxprt-code/project-plans/20251027-stateless5/execution-tracker.md`

## Success Criteria Met
✓ Stakeholders can review objectives and requirements that accurately scope the stateless foreground agent work
✓ All planning artifacts are properly structured and traceable
✓ Phase tracking infrastructure is initialized and ready for implementation phases

## Next Phase
Phase 01 (P01): Deep analysis of state coupling in GeminiClient, GeminiChat, and CLI runtime helpers.

## Notes
- This is a planning-only phase with no code modifications
- No build/test/lint verification required (documentation artifacts only)
- All requirements (REQ-STAT5-001 through REQ-STAT5-005) are clearly defined and traceable
- Architectural decisions (AD-STAT5-01 through AD-STAT5-05) provide clear implementation guidance
