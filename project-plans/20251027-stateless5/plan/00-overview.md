# Phase 00: Plan Overview & Objectives

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20251027-STATELESS5.P00`

## Prerequisites
- None (initial phase).
- Verification: N/A.
- Expected files from previous phase: N/A.

## Implementation Tasks

### Files to Create
- `project-plans/20251027-stateless5/overview.md`
  - Already created; confirm objectives align with requirements.
- `project-plans/20251027-stateless5/specification.md`
  - Already created; ensure requirements are enumerated and traceable.

### Files to Modify
- `project-plans/20251027-stateless5/execution-tracker.md`
  - Initialize tracker entries for all phases (completed).

### Required Code Markers
- N/A (planning artifacts only).

## Verification Commands

### Automated Checks
```bash
# Ensure overview/specification exist
ls project-plans/20251027-stateless5/overview.md
ls project-plans/20251027-stateless5/specification.md

# Validate tracker structure references phases sequentially
rg "PLAN-20251027-STATELESS5" project-plans/20251027-stateless5/execution-tracker.md
```

### Manual Verification Checklist
- [ ] Overview documents objectives aligning with REQ-STAT5-001..005.
- [ ] Specification lists success metrics, architectural decisions, and verification strategy.
- [ ] Execution tracker enumerates all phases (including verification phases) sequentially.

## Success Criteria
- Stakeholders agree the objectives and requirements accurately scope the stateless foreground agent work.

## Failure Recovery
1. Update overview/specification to address feedback.
2. Re-run verification commands.

## Phase Completion Marker
Create `project-plans/20251027-stateless5/.completed/P00.md` summarizing finalized objectives and tracker initialization.
