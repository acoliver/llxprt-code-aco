# Phase 03a: AgentRuntimeState Stub Verification

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20251027-STATELESS5.P03a`

## Prerequisites
- Required: Phase 03 completed.
- Verification: `rg "@plan:PLAN-20251027-STATELESS5.P03" packages/core/src/runtime`
- Expected files: `.completed/P03.md`, stub implementation and exports.

## Verification Tasks
- Confirm stubs align with pseudocode contract (runtime-state.md lines 10-32).
- Ensure no business logic implemented prematurely.
- Record command outputs demonstrating clean workspace.

## Verification Commands
```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm format:check
pnpm build
pnpm test --filter "PLAN-20251027-STATELESS5.P03" || true
git status --short
```

## Manual Verification Checklist
- [ ] Stub functions throw or return placeholders as expected.
- [ ] No additional files modified inadvertently.
- [ ] Tracker updated marking P03a complete.

## Success Criteria
- Ready to write failing tests in Phase 04 without stray implementation work.

## Failure Recovery
1. Restore stub files to placeholder-only implementation.
2. Re-run verification commands.

## Phase Completion Marker
Create `project-plans/20251027-stateless5/.completed/P03a.md` attaching command output snippets and reviewer notes.
