# Phase 02: Pseudocode & Interface Design

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20251027-STATELESS5.P02`

## Prerequisites
- Required: Phase 01a completed.
- Verification: `grep -r "@plan:PLAN-20251027-STATELESS5.P01a" project-plans/20251027-stateless5`
- Expected files: `.completed/P01a.md`, analysis artifacts referencing all requirements.

## Implementation Tasks

### Files to Create
- `project-plans/20251027-stateless5/analysis/pseudocode/runtime-state.md`
  - Define `AgentRuntimeState` API (constructors, getters, immutable update methods) with explicit field contract and invariants derived from design-questions.md.
  - Include enumerated pseudocode steps (numbered lines) covering TDD scenarios for REQ-STAT5-001/002.
- `project-plans/20251027-stateless5/analysis/pseudocode/gemini-runtime.md`
  - Outline `GeminiClient` and `GeminiChat` call sequences using runtime state, detailing interactions with `ProviderRuntimeContext` and Config mirror points.
  - Specify how history service is injected and reused.
  - Provide explicit error handling paths and migration checkpoints for slash commands/tests.

### Files to Modify
- `project-plans/20251027-stateless5/execution-tracker.md`
  - Update phase status.

### Required Code Markers
- Every pseudocode block must annotate requirement coverage using `@requirement:REQ-STAT5-00X`.
- Enumerate steps with line numbers (Markdown ordered lists) for later reference.

## Verification Commands

### Automated Checks
```bash
rg "@requirement:REQ-STAT5" project-plans/20251027-stateless5/analysis/pseudocode
```

### Manual Verification Checklist
- [ ] Pseudocode provides end-to-end flow from CLI command → runtime state → GeminiClient → GeminiChat → provider.
- [ ] Field contract/invariants for AgentRuntimeState explicitly enumerated with references to design-questions.md.
- [ ] Error handling and telemetry hooks called out for implementation.
- [ ] Migration checkpoints for slash-command/tests identified.
- [ ] All forthcoming implementation phases can reference specific pseudocode line numbers.

## Success Criteria
- Pseudocode gives unambiguous blueprint for TDD and implementation phases.

## Failure Recovery
1. Update pseudocode files to address gaps or ambiguity.
2. Re-run verification commands.

## Phase Completion Marker
Create `project-plans/20251027-stateless5/.completed/P02.md` summarizing key pseudocode references for each requirement.
