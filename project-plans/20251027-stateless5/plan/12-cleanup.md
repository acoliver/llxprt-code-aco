# Phase 12: Cleanup & Regression Guards

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20251027-STATELESS5.P12`

## Prerequisites
- Required: Phase 11a completed.
- Verification: `rg "@plan:PLAN-20251027-STATELESS5.P11a" project-plans/20251027-stateless5`
- Expected files: `.completed/P11a.md`, final implementation artifacts.

## Implementation Tasks

### Files to Modify
- Remove obsolete Config fields/tests identified during migration.
- Add regression tests ensuring new runtime state flows remain enforced (e.g., guard against Config fallback reintroduction).
- Update CHANGELOG or release notes if applicable.
- Ensure plan markers exist for all new artifacts (backfill if necessary).
- `project-plans/20251027-stateless5/execution-tracker.md` (final status update).

### Required Code Markers
- All cleanup changes annotated with `@plan:PLAN-20251027-STATELESS5.P12` and associated requirement references.

## Verification Commands
```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm format:check
pnpm build
pnpm test --runInBand
```

### Manual Verification Checklist
- [ ] No TODOs or commented-out code remain from refactor.
- [ ] Plan markers/requirement tags audited across repository.
- [ ] Execution tracker updated; `.completed/P12.md` prepared.

## Success Criteria
- Codebase tidy, tests green, plan artifacts complete.

## Failure Recovery
1. Address lingering items and rerun verification commands.
2. Ensure final regression tests cover gaps before concluding.

## Phase Completion Marker
Create `project-plans/20251027-stateless5/.completed/P12.md` summarizing cleanup actions and verification logs.
