# Phase 06a: CLI Runtime Adapter Stub Verification

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20251027-STATELESS5.P06a`

## Prerequisites
- Required: Phase 06 completed.
- Verification: `rg "@plan:PLAN-20251027-STATELESS5.P06" packages/cli/src/runtime`
- Expected files: `.completed/P06.md`, stub code.

## Verification Tasks
- Confirm adapter stub introduces no runtime changes.
- Ensure lint/typecheck/format/build remain green.

## Verification Commands
```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm format:check
pnpm build
pnpm test --filter "PLAN-20251027-STATELESS5.P06" || true
git status --short
```

## Manual Verification Checklist
- [ ] Adapter stub functions only delegate to legacy Config pathways.
- [ ] Workspace clean aside from expected staged files.
- [ ] Tracker reflects verification completion.

## Success Criteria
- Safe landing point for subsequent TDD phases.

## Failure Recovery
1. Revert unintended code and restore stub-only behavior.
2. Re-run verification commands.

## Phase Completion Marker
Create `project-plans/20251027-stateless5/.completed/P06a.md` with command logs and reviewer commentary.
