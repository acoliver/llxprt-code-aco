# Phase 04a: AgentRuntimeState TDD Verification

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20251027-STATELESS5.P04a`

## Prerequisites
- Required: Phase 04 completed.
- Verification: `rg "@plan:PLAN-20251027-STATELESS5.P04" packages/core/src/runtime/__tests__`
- Expected files: `.completed/P04.md`, failing test log.

## Verification Tasks
- Capture failing test output (should indicate unimplemented runtime state behavior).
- Confirm lint/typecheck/build still pass.
- Ensure tracker updated with P04a verification entry.

## Verification Commands
```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm format:check
pnpm build
pnpm test --filter "PLAN-20251027-STATELESS5.P04" && echo "ERROR: tests passed unexpectedly" && exit 1 || echo "Expected failure captured"
git status --short
```

## Manual Verification Checklist
- [ ] Recorded failure message references missing implementation (not test issues).
- [ ] Workspace clean aside from expected test files.
- [ ] Execution tracker updated.

## Success Criteria
- Evidence stored showing tests fail for the correct reason, enabling implementation phase.

## Failure Recovery
1. Adjust tests if failure reason is incorrect.
2. Re-run verification commands and update logs.

## Phase Completion Marker
Create `project-plans/20251027-stateless5/.completed/P04a.md` including failure excerpt and checklist confirmation.
