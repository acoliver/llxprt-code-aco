# Phase 08a: CLI Runtime Adapter Implementation Verification

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20251027-STATELESS5.P08a`

## Prerequisites
- Required: Phase 08 completed.
- Verification: `rg "@plan:PLAN-20251027-STATELESS5.P08" packages/cli/src`
- Expected files: `.completed/P08.md`, passing test outputs.

## Verification Tasks
- Run comprehensive CLI test suites to detect regressions.
- Execute targeted integration tests focusing on profile loading and slash commands.

## Verification Commands
```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm format:check
pnpm build
pnpm test --filter "PLAN-20251027-STATELESS5.P07" --runInBand
pnpm test --workspace packages/cli --runInBand
pnpm test --workspace integration-tests --runInBand || true
pnpm test --filter "profile" --runInBand || true
git status --short
```

## Manual Verification Checklist
- [ ] All adapter-related tests stable and green.
- [ ] Integration tests confirm CLI flags/slash commands operate through runtime state.
- [ ] No unintended Config mutations remain (manual code inspection or logging as needed).

## Success Criteria
- CLI runtime relies exclusively on `AgentRuntimeState` with no regressions.

## Failure Recovery
1. Address failing tests/regressions.
2. Re-run verification commands.

## Phase Completion Marker
Create `project-plans/20251027-stateless5/.completed/P08a.md` summarizing verification evidence and outstanding follow-ups (if any).
