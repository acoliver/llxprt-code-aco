# Phase 01a: Analysis Verification

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20251027-STATELESS5.P01a`

## Prerequisites
- Required: Phase 01 completed.
- Verification: `grep -r "@plan:PLAN-20251027-STATELESS5.P01" project-plans/20251027-stateless5`
- Expected files: `.completed/P01.md`, updated tracker row.

## Verification Tasks
- Validate analysis coverage against requirements.
- Confirm design questions have documented answers (AgentRuntimeState contract, ProviderRuntimeContext relationship, Config migration, slash-command/test scope, Config boundary decisions).
- Ensure risks, integrations, and open questions align with plan objectives.
- Ensure documents reference specific files/lines for later remediation.

## Verification Commands
```bash
rg "@requirement:REQ-STAT5" project-plans/20251027-stateless5/analysis
```

## Manual Verification Checklist
- [ ] Analysis documents cite all key touchpoints (runtimeSettings, slash commands, GeminiClient, GeminiChat).
- [ ] Design question document answers interface contract, ProviderRuntimeContext relationship, migration strategy, slash-command/test coverage scope, and Config augmentation boundaries.
- [ ] Risks include mitigation steps aligned with upcoming phases.
- [ ] Tracker updated with verification status.

## Success Criteria
- No unresolved analysis gaps before starting pseudocode phase.

## Failure Recovery
1. Update analysis docs to fix gaps.
2. Re-run verification commands.

## Phase Completion Marker
Create `project-plans/20251027-stateless5/.completed/P01a.md` logging verification outputs and reviewer notes.
