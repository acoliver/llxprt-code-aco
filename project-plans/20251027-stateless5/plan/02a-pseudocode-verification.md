# Phase 02a: Pseudocode Verification

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20251027-STATELESS5.P02a`

## Prerequisites
- Required: Phase 02 completed.
- Verification: `grep -r "@plan:PLAN-20251027-STATELESS5.P02" project-plans/20251027-stateless5`
- Expected files: `.completed/P02.md`, pseudocode documents.

## Verification Tasks
- Confirm pseudocode steps cover all requirements and reference relevant analysis findings.
- Verify AgentRuntimeState field contract and ProviderRuntimeContext integration spelled out per design questions.
- Check numbering/line references for later implementation phases.
- Validate that each implementation phase cites correct pseudocode sections.

## Verification Commands
```bash
rg "PLAN-20251027-STATELESS5.P02" project-plans/20251027-stateless5/analysis/pseudocode
rg "@requirement:REQ-STAT5" project-plans/20251027-stateless5/analysis/pseudocode
rg "^[0-9]+\\." project-plans/20251027-stateless5/analysis/pseudocode/runtime-state.md
rg "^[0-9]+\\." project-plans/20251027-stateless5/analysis/pseudocode/gemini-runtime.md
```

## Manual Verification Checklist
- [ ] Every requirement mapped to explicit pseudocode section.
- [ ] Field contract/invariants and migration checkpoints documented.
- [ ] Failure modes and error handling captured.
- [ ] Tracker updated with verification results.

## Success Criteria
- Pseudocode ready for TDD phases without ambiguity.

## Failure Recovery
1. Update pseudocode to resolve issues.
2. Re-run verification commands.

## Phase Completion Marker
Create `project-plans/20251027-stateless5/.completed/P02a.md` recording verification notes and reviewer sign-off.
