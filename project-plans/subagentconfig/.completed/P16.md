# Phase 16: Final Verification Complete

**Completed**: 2025-10-10 15:45 PDT

## Outcome
- Verification activities executed per `plan/16-verification.md`.
- Automated checks all green after addressing coverage temp directory precondition.
- Manual CLI walkthrough remains outstanding for stakeholder sign-off.

## Key Artifacts
- `project-plans/subagentconfig/verification-report.md` (updated with metrics and observations).
- Terminal transcripts for:
  - `npm run typecheck`
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm test`
  - `npm run clean`
  - `npm run build`

## Metrics Snapshot
- Plan markers (`@plan:PLAN-20250117-SUBAGENTCONFIG.*`): 308 across phases P03–P15 (P01–P02 are design-only).
- Requirement markers (`@requirement:REQ-001`…`REQ-015`): 323 total after adding explicit tags for REQ-012 and REQ-015.
- Automated tests:
  - A2A server: 21 tests, 0 skipped, 0 failed.
  - CLI: 1,124 tests, 11 skipped, 0 failed.
  - Core: 3,145 tests, 55 skipped, 0 failed.
  - VS Code companion: 26 tests, 1 skipped, 0 failed.
- Build pipeline: typecheck, lint, clean, build all succeeded.

## Notable Notes
1. Created `packages/core/coverage/.tmp/` before rerunning `npm test` to satisfy Vitest coverage writer (otherwise ENOENT).
2. Added explicit requirement annotations:
   - `packages/core/src/config/types.ts`: split REQ-012 onto its own line.
   - `packages/cli/src/ui/commands/subagentCommand.ts`: tagged save/delete/edit success paths with REQ-015.
3. Plan marker check flags for P01/P02 are expected because those phases are documentation-only.
4. Manual verification scenarios listed in the verification report are ready but were not executed within this phase.

## Next Steps
1. Run interactive CLI manual tests outlined in the report.
2. Capture user acceptance sign-off once manual checks pass.
3. Consider pruning generated coverage artifacts (`packages/*/coverage/`) before packaging if size is a concern.

Phase 16 is now closed with documentation and traceability in sync with the implemented codebase.
