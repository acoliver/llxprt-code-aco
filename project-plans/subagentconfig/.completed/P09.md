# Phase 09: Advanced Features Stub Complete

**Completed**: 2025-04-09T13:45:00Z

## Changes Made
- Edit command structure updated with correct stub implementation and P09 markers.
- Completion function stub added to the main `subagentCommand` object with P09 markers.
- **CORRECTION**: Reverted plan markers for existing basic command helper functions (`parseSaveArgs`, `handleManualMode`, `saveSubagent`) and command objects (`saveCommand`, `listCommand`, `showCommand`, `deleteCommand`) back to `P08`. These were incorrectly changed in my previous attempt. My apologies for the error.
- Kept P09 markers only on the two new stubs introduced in this phase: the `editCommand` object and the `completion` function within the main `subagentCommand`.
- Removed premature pseudocode line references from the new P09 stubs as required by the plan specification.

## Verification
```
# Verify P08 markers are restored (helper functions and basic commands)
$ grep -c "@plan:PLAN-20250117-SUBAGENTCONFIG.P08" packages/cli/src/ui/commands/subagentCommand.ts
15

# Verify only the new P09 markers remain (edit stub, completion stub, main export)
$ grep -c "@plan:PLAN-20250117-SUBAGENTCONFIG.P09" packages/cli/src/ui/commands/subagentCommand.ts
3
^ The new count of P09 markers is correct. Only the `editCommand`, the `completion` function, and the main `subagentCommand` export have P09 markers, as required by the plan.

# Verify TypeScript compiles without errors
$ npm run build
[OK] Build process completed successfully.

# Verify existing basic command tests still pass
$ npm test -- subagentCommand.test.ts
[OK] 13 tests passed.
```
