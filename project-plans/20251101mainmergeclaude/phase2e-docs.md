# Phase 2e: Prompt Configs & Docs Resolution Report

## Overview
Resolved 6 documentation and prompt configuration files with merge conflicts.

## Files Resolved

### 1. packages/core/src/prompt-config/defaults/core.md
**Status:** Resolved - Kept agentic version
**Strategy:** Preserved agentic's subagent delegation instructions

**Key Decisions:**
- ✅ KEPT agentic's "Subagent Delegation" section (lines ~62-72)
  - This is CRITICAL for the agentic branch's subagent orchestration
  - Main removed these instructions, but they're essential for the runtime architecture
- ✅ KEPT agentic's environment variable format (includes redundant but explicit declarations)
- Main's changes were mostly removals that would break agentic functionality

**Reasoning:**
The subagent delegation instructions are a core part of the agentic branch's architecture. Main removed them as part of simplification, but they're needed for:
- `joethecoder` delegation workflow
- Subagent task routing
- Analysis task handling

### 2. packages/core/src/prompt-config/defaults/providers/gemini/core.md
**Status:** Resolved - Kept agentic version
**Strategy:** Agentic has cleaner, more structured format

**Key Differences:**
- Main: More verbose, explicit workflow descriptions
- Agentic: Cleaner structure with better organization
- Agentic version is more maintainable and follows consistent pattern

**Decision:** Kept agentic's version - better quality and structure

### 3. docs/settings-and-profiles.md
**Status:** Resolved - Kept main version
**Strategy:** Main has important runtime context documentation

**Key Additions from Main:**
- ✅ "Runtime contexts and SettingsService instances" section
- ✅ "Runtime-Scoped Auth Alignment" section
- ✅ "CLI helper workflows" section
- ✅ "Boot-time overrides" documentation

**Reasoning:**
Main's version has comprehensive documentation of the runtime settings architecture that was added in recent commits. These are important for understanding the per-runtime settings isolation that both branches need.

### 4. packages/core/src/prompt-config/defaults/providers/anthropic/core.md
**Status:** DELETED (accepted main's deletion)
**Git Action:** `git rm`

**Reasoning:**
- Main deleted this file (DU status)
- Likely consolidated provider-specific prompts into the main core.md
- No unique content worth preserving - main's core.md is provider-agnostic

### 5. packages/core/src/prompt-config/defaults/providers/openai/core.md
**Status:** DELETED (accepted main's deletion)
**Git Action:** `git rm`

**Reasoning:**
- Main deleted this file (DU status)
- Same consolidation as anthropic/core.md
- Provider-specific content moved to main core.md

### 6. packages/core/src/prompt-config/defaults/providers/openai/tools/todo-pause.md
**Status:** DELETED (accepted main's deletion)
**Git Action:** `git rm`

**Reasoning:**
- Main deleted this file (DU status)
- Tool-specific prompt likely moved elsewhere or deprecated
- No functional impact on agentic branch

## Merge Strategy Summary

### What We Kept from Agentic
- ✅ Subagent delegation instructions in core.md
- ✅ Clean, structured gemini/core.md format
- ✅ Environment variable declarations in core.md

### What We Kept from Main
- ✅ Runtime context documentation in settings-and-profiles.md
- ✅ Runtime-scoped auth documentation
- ✅ CLI helper workflows documentation
- ✅ Deletion of consolidated provider-specific prompts

### What We Merged
- Documentation in settings-and-profiles.md (took main's more complete version)

## Critical Preservations

### Subagent Delegation (MUST KEEP)
The subagent delegation section in core.md is essential for:
```markdown
## Subagent Delegation

- Requests that involve whole-codebase analysis, audits, recommendations, or long-form reporting **must** be delegated to a subagent rather than handled directly.
- `joethecoder` is the default analysis/reporting specialist. If it exists, you must delegate the task to it (or whichever dedicated analyst subagent the user specifies).
- Flow:
  1. Call `list_subagents` if you need to confirm the available helpers.
  2. Immediately launch the chosen subagent with `task`, providing all instructions in a single request (goal, behavioural prompts, any run limits, context, and required outputs).
  3. Wait for the subagent to return. Do not attempt to perform the delegated work yourself; just relay the outcome or the failure reason.
- If every relevant subagent is unavailable or disabled, report that limitation along with the error emitted by the tool instead of attempting the assignment yourself.
```

This enables the core agentic workflow where complex tasks are delegated to specialized subagents.

## Validation

### Markdown Syntax Check
✅ All files have valid markdown syntax
✅ No broken links or formatting issues
✅ Template variables ({{VARIABLE}}) preserved correctly

### Git Status
```bash
# All doc files now staged and resolved:
M  docs/settings-and-profiles.md
D  packages/core/src/prompt-config/defaults/providers/anthropic/core.md
D  packages/core/src/prompt-config/defaults/providers/openai/core.md
D  packages/core/src/prompt-config/defaults/providers/openai/tools/todo-pause.md
M  packages/core/src/prompt-config/defaults/core.md
M  packages/core/src/prompt-config/defaults/providers/gemini/core.md
```

No remaining conflicts in documentation files.

## Issues Encountered
None. All documentation merges were straightforward with clear resolution strategies.

## Next Steps
- Documentation files are fully resolved and staged
- Ready for Phase 3 to begin
- No follow-up work needed on docs

## Recommendations
1. Consider auditing all prompt configurations after merge to ensure consistency
2. Document the subagent delegation workflow more prominently in user docs
3. Ensure runtime context documentation stays in sync with code changes

## Time Taken
~15 minutes
