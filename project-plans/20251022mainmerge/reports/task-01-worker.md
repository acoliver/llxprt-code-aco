# Task 01 – Worker Report

## Summary of Changes
- Applied upstream CLI resize debounce hook (`40e634a02`) so `useTerminalSize` now reacts to `stdout` resize events with a 150 ms debounce instead of interval polling.
- Pulled in the shell tool output filtering and limiter updates (`58dd8f217`, `e9229b51f`), adding head/tail/grep filters, accurate token estimation via tiktoken, and extensive test coverage while preserving agentic summarization logic.
- Integrated gitignore realpath fixes for file discovery and read-many-files tooling (`475fa44f2`), ensuring workspace-nested repos respect repo-level ignore rules.
- Adopted Gemini pending-token compression guard rails (`e5e4025be`), adding pre-send token estimation through the history service without regressing stateless provider handling.

## Conflicts & Resolutions
- No textual merge conflicts during cherry-picks. Verified agentic-specific pathways (server tools provider summarization, stateless bootstrap checks) still compile with upstream changes.

## Verification
- `npm run lint -- packages/cli/src/ui/hooks/useTerminalSize.ts packages/core/src/tools/shell.ts packages/core/src/utils/toolOutputLimiter.ts` → ✅
- `npm run test --workspace @vybestack/llxprt-code-core -- src/tools/shell.test.ts src/utils/toolOutputLimiter.test.ts src/tools/read-many-files.test.ts src/services/fileDiscoveryService.test.ts src/core/geminiChat.test.ts` → ✅ (all targeted suites passed)

## Remaining Concerns
- Added tokenizer-based token estimation introduces a `TextDecoder` fallback; keep an eye out for environments lacking WASM support for `@dqbd/tiktoken`.
- No additional CLI validation was run beyond linting; consider a manual run of the CLI shell command workflow if time allows.
