# Task 04 – Worker Report

## Summary of Changes
- Replayed `f08588c07` while retaining our 0.5.0 workspace versioning; only `@vybestack/llxprt-code-a2a-server` advanced to 0.4.3, and the lockfile was reconciled without downgrading agentic releases.
- Adopted the contributor acknowledgements block from `011300fe7`, wiring `gh pr view` into the release notes generator with the repository token so external PR authors are credited automatically.
- Pulled in `634d2a8dd` to bundle sandbox package tarballs, authenticate to GHCR, and build/push the sandbox image directly from the release workflow, removing the redundant release trigger from `build-sandbox.yml`.

## Conflicts & Resolutions
- Version bump commit introduced conflicts in `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and the CLI/core/test-utils/vscode package manifests. Chose our existing `0.5.0` values, manually edited the lockfile blocks, and staged the resolved files before continuing the cherry-pick.
- No further textual conflicts; reviewed the new sandbox publish steps to confirm they stay gated behind the `dry_run` flag and respect the existing `github.repository == 'vybestack/llxprt-code'` guard used in our agentic pipeline.

## Verification
- `npm run lint` → ✅ (`eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx && eslint integration-tests`)
- `npm run typecheck --workspaces --if-present` → ✅ (tsc completed for a2a-server, cli, core, and test-utils workspaces)

## Remaining Concerns
- Our root `package.json` still points `config.sandboxImageUri` at `ghcr.io/acoliver/llxprt-code`, while the release workflow now publishes to `ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}/sandbox`; confirm whether we should add an override hook or realign the default image tag before the next production run.
- Contributor credit lookup depends on the `GITHUB_TOKEN` having PR read scope; worth spot-checking on the next dry-run to ensure rate limits or forks do not block the `gh pr view` calls.
