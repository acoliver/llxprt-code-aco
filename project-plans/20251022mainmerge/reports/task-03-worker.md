# Task 03 Worker Report (P03)

## Summary
- Cherry-picked upstream commits 001a2ffe2 (postinstall packaging), c9d8ad075 (tool registry + prompt filtering fixes), and e475f75ed (prompt-interactive bootstrap) onto `agentic`.
- Updated system prompt plumbing to pass enabled tool names through `getCoreSystemPromptAsync`, keeping stateless provider runtime (`GeminiClient`, Anthropic/OpenAI providers) aligned with agentic/subagent flows.
- Adopted upstream tool registry concurrency patch while preserving branch-specific MCP/server context management and discovered tool descriptions.
- Integrated CLI fix for `--prompt-interactive` without disturbing Task 02 prompt queue/streaming hooks (initial submission now gated on client presence rather than deprecated readiness flag).

## Conflicts & Resolutions
- `packages/core/src/core/client.ts`: merged upstream `enabledToolNames` prompt filtering with our options-object signature, passing `provider` and tool list together so Gemini prompt generation still respects stateless provider selection.
- `packages/core/src/providers/anthropic/AnthropicProvider.ts`: re-implemented `toolNamesArg` as `toolNamesForPrompt` while continuing to rely on `options.resolved.authToken` caching and runtime reuse. OAuth/non-OAuth system prompts now receive tool list without reintroducing old client recreation path.
- `packages/core/src/providers/gemini/GeminiProvider.ts`: added deduped tool name extraction beside existing server tool wiring/cache logic, and wired prompts (OAuth + API) to include tool names while retaining runtime cache + server tool metadata used by agentic streaming.
- `packages/core/src/providers/openai/OpenAIProvider.ts` and `packages/core/src/providers/openai-responses/OpenAIResponsesProvider.ts`: injected tool list into prompt calls, keeping branch-specific model resolution and stateless auth precedence intact.
- Ran `npm run format` after cherry-pick hook demanded formatting; no semantic changes introduced.

## Verification
- `npx eslint packages/core/src/core/client.ts packages/core/src/tools/tool-registry.ts packages/core/src/providers/anthropic/AnthropicProvider.ts packages/core/src/providers/gemini/GeminiProvider.ts packages/core/src/providers/openai/OpenAIProvider.ts packages/core/src/providers/openai-responses/OpenAIResponsesProvider.ts` (pass)
- `npx eslint packages/cli/src/ui/App.tsx packages/cli/src/ui/App.test.tsx` (pass)
- `npx vitest run packages/core/src/tools/tool-registry.test.ts` (pass, with existing warnings about missing prompt markdown and optional account metadata in sandbox)
- `DEBUG=llxprt:cli node scripts/start.js --profile-load synthetic --prompt "say hello"` (smoke OK, CLI warns about stale build artifacts and logs expected provider initialization)

## Follow-up / Observations
- Vitest sandbox continues to warn about absent prompt markdown and mock account files; behaviour matches prior runs and does not block tests but worth monitoring if prompt assets are moved.
- CLI smoke run warns that `npm run build` should be rerun because UI files changed; no action taken during this task per instructions.
