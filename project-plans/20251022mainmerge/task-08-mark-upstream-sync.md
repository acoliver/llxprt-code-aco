## Task 08 – Mark Upstream Sync Completion

### Objective
After all cherry-picks (Tasks 01–07) succeed and the branch builds/tests cleanly, record the upstream main commit SHA we synchronized to, following `dev-docs/cherrypicking.md`.

### Steps
1. Determine the upstream main SHA used for the cherry-picks (the latest commit from `upstream/main` when we began).
2. Create a new commit with a message such as:
   ```
   chore: record upstream sync to <sha>
   ```
   Include a short note in the commit body referencing the plan directory (`project-plans/20251022mainmerge/`).
3. Document the SHA (and date) inside this plan directory if additional traceability is desired.

### Acceptance Notes
- Ensure all tasks are complete and tests pass before creating this commit.
- This marking commit should be the final step prior to resuming new feature work.
