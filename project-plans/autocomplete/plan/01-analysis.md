# Phase 01: Analysis

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20251013-AUTOCOMPLETE.P01`

## Prerequisites
- Specification completed (`project-plans/autocomplete/specification.md`)
- Execution tracker initialized (`project-plans/autocomplete/plan/execution-tracker.md`)

## Implementation Tasks

### Files to Create / Update
- `project-plans/autocomplete/analysis/domain-analysis.md`
  - Embed integration analysis per specification (existing code to modify, code to remove, user entry points, migration requirements).
  - Tag sections with `@plan:PLAN-20250214-AUTOCOMPLETE.P01` and requirements `REQ-001`..`REQ-006` as applicable.
  - Document risks regarding token parsing, async completers, and mandatory property/mutation testing.

### Required Markers
Ensure each subsection includes comment blocks:
```markdown
<!-- @plan:PLAN-20250214-AUTOCOMPLETE.P01 @requirement:REQ-00X -->
```

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Ensure analysis file exists and contains plan markers
test -f project-plans/autocomplete/analysis/domain-analysis.md
rg "@plan:PLAN-20250214-AUTOCOMPLETE.P01" project-plans/autocomplete/analysis/domain-analysis.md
```

## Manual Verification Checklist
- [ ] Integration analysis lists precise files to modify/remove
- [ ] Risks and mitigation strategies captured
- [ ] Requirements mapped within analysis

## Success Criteria
- Comprehensive analysis committed with traceable plan markers.

## Failure Recovery
- If analysis incomplete, delete the file and re-run this phase.

## Phase Completion Marker
- Create `project-plans/autocomplete/.completed/P01.md` summarizing analysis findings and verification outputs.
