# Phase 07a Completion Marker

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20251013-AUTOCOMPLETE.P07a`

## Completion Date
2025-10-16

## Verification Results

### Test Command (expected RED)
```bash
$ (cd packages/cli && npm test -- --testNamePattern "@plan:PLAN-20250214-AUTOCOMPLETE.P07")
> @vybestack/llxprt-code@0.4.2 test
> vitest run --testNamePattern @plan:PLAN-20250214-AUTOCOMPLETE.P07

 FAIL  src/ui/commands/subagentCommand.phase07.test.ts > real data integration > should return actual subagent names from completion handler
 FAIL  src/ui/commands/subagentCommand.phase07.test.ts > real data integration > should provide profile suggestions after name argument
 FAIL  src/ui/commands/subagentCommand.phase07.test.ts > property-based stability > maintains stable completion with dynamic profile options

Test Files  39 failed | 182 skipped (221)
Tests       10 failed | 2 passed | 2372 skipped (2384)
```

### Command Adjustments
- Initial attempt with `npm test -- --filter "@plan:PLAN-20250214-AUTOCOMPLETE.P07"` failed (`vitest` v3.2.4 no longer accepts `--filter`).
- Switched to `--testNamePattern`, matching the Phase 07 annotations already embedded in the test files.

### Verification Notes
- Added Phase 07a verification banner to `packages/cli/src/integration-tests/useSlashCompletion.phase07.test.ts` documenting the relocation caused by React 19 exclusion rules.
- Existing verification comments in `packages/cli/src/ui/commands/subagentCommand.phase07.test.ts` remain accurate (location move + RED status tied to `.completed/P07.md`).
- No test behavior changes were introduced; anti-fraud checks from Phase 07 remain valid.

## Manual Verification Checklist
- [x] Failure traces stored (`.completed/P07.md` plus log excerpt above)
- [x] Anti-fraud checks unnecessary (no test edits beyond documentation)
- [x] Execution tracker updated for P07/P07a

## Success Criteria
- [x] RED state reconfirmed after relocation, matching Phase 07 expectations
- [x] Verification markers present in both relocated integration test files

## Next Steps
- Proceed to Phase 08: implement `/subagent` schema integration to satisfy failing tests.
