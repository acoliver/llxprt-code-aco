# Phase 09a: `/set` Migration TDD Verification

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20251013-AUTOCOMPLETE.P09a`

## Verification Date
2025-10-16 (initial RED capture)  
Updated: 2025-10-15 (current run)

## Verification Steps

```bash
cd packages/cli
npx vitest run src/ui/commands/test/setCommand.phase09.test.ts
# 13 passed

npx vitest run src/ui/hooks/__tests__/useSlashCompletion.set.phase09.test.ts
# 3 passed
```

## Observations

- Resolver suite now GREEN end-to-end; all literal/value/hint positions align with the implemented schema.
- Hook contract suite confirms `setCommand.schema` is exported and structurally sound.
- Property ratio (4 / 13) preserved after implementation.

## Anti-Fraud Checklist

- No spy assertions detected (`rg "toHaveBeenCalled"` ➜ none).
- No reverse-testing markers present.
- Property-based share ≥ 30%.

## Tracker Update

`execution-tracker.md` → P09 `[OK]` (spec authored), P09a `[OK]` (verification rerun with GREEN status).

## Notes

- Phase 09 suites are mandatory regression coverage for future `/set` changes; keep them on the mutation allowlist.
- Any new schema branches should add parallel tests plus verification steps recorded here.
