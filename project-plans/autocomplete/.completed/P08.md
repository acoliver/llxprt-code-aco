# Phase 08: Integration Implementation – `/subagent`

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20251013-AUTOCOMPLETE.P08`

## Completion Date
2025-10-16

## Implementation Summary
- Hardened `createCompletionHandler` branch handling by extending the tokenization suite (prefix stripping, literal hint fallbacks) and adding `/subagent`-specific integration tests that exercise the schema inputs produced by `useSlashCompletion`.
- Retained the hook integration from Phase 08 but confirmed it delivers normalized argument metadata that now drives the new schema tests.
- Updated Vitest/Stryker configuration so the focused suites run inside the sandbox without tsconfig path issues; mutation analysis now succeeds above the 70% goal.

## Verification Results
### Targeted Test Runs
```bash
$ (cd packages/cli && npx vitest run --config packages/cli/vitest.config.ts src/ui/commands/test/subagentCommand.schema.test.ts)
 ✓ src/ui/commands/test/subagentCommand.schema.test.ts (5 tests) 3ms

 Test Files  1 passed (1)
      Tests  5 passed (5)
```

```bash
$ (cd packages/cli && npx vitest run --config packages/cli/vitest.config.ts src/ui/commands/schema/argumentResolver.test.ts)
 ✓ src/ui/commands/schema/argumentResolver.test.ts (42 tests) 105ms

 Test Files  1 passed (1)
      Tests  42 passed (42)
```

### Mutation Testing
```bash
$ (cd packages/cli && npx stryker run)
...
All files | % Mutation score 71.25 | # killed 277 | # survived 95 | # timeout 3
```

## Manual Verification Checklist
- [x] Schema handler traces confirmed to select literals/value steps in the expected order.
- [x] Hook integration inspected to ensure `commandPathLength`, `completedArgs`, and `partialArg` are emitted on every invocation.
- [x] Mutation score ≥ 70% (71.25% via focused Stryker run).

## Notes
- React-based integration tests in `src/integration-tests/useSlashCompletion.phase07.test.ts` remain excluded because of upstream React 19 issues; schema behaviour is now covered by the new Vitest suite.
- Mutation configuration now points at `src/ui/commands/test/subagentCommand.schema.test.ts` alongside the resolver suite so `/subagent` flows stay under mutation coverage.
