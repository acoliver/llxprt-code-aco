# Phase 10a: `/set` Implementation Verification

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20251013-AUTOCOMPLETE.P10a`

## Verification Date
2025-10-15

## Commands Executed

```bash
# Type safety
npm run typecheck

# Build (workspace bundle)
npm run build

# Focused Vitest suites
npx vitest run \
  src/ui/commands/test/setCommand.phase09.test.ts \
  src/ui/commands/test/setCommand.mutation.test.ts \
  src/ui/commands/test/subagentCommand.schema.test.ts \
  src/ui/hooks/__tests__/useSlashCompletion.set.phase09.test.ts

# Mutation analysis (Stryker)
npx stryker run
```

## Results

| Check | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| Typecheck | ✅ `tsc --noEmit` clean |
| Build | ✅ All packages built successfully |
| Vitest suites | ✅ 13 + 12 + 6 + 3 tests passing |
| Mutation score | ✅ **73.67%** (288 killed / 395 tested, 3 timeouts) |
| Survivors | Remaining mutants concentrated in tokenization guard rails (`tokenize` boolean literals, conditional short-circuits). |

### Mutation Report

- Location: `packages/cli/reports/mutation/mutation.json` and `mutation.html`
- Mutate target: `src/ui/commands/schema/index.ts`
- Focused test list defined by `vitest.config.mutation.ts`

## Observed Behaviour

- Tab completion no longer replays the same literal suggestion after acceptance.
- `/set modelparam` and `/set custom-headers` surface value suggestions immediately.
- `/subagent create …` now resolves to the same schema as `/subagent save`.

## Checklist

- [x] Type safety confirmed
- [x] Build artifacts produced
- [x] Relevant Vitest suites green
- [x] Mutation score ≥ 70%
- [x] Documentation updated (`dev-docs/stryker.md`, plan tracker)

## Artifacts Updated

- `dev-docs/stryker.md` – new guidance for mutation runs
- `project-plans/autocomplete/.completed/P09*.md`, `.completed/P10*.md` – aligned with GREEN status
- `project-plans/autocomplete/plan/execution-tracker.md` – marked P10/P10a as complete with latest verification data
