# Phase 09: `/set` Migration TDD

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20251013-AUTOCOMPLETE.P09`

## Completion Date
2025-10-16 (test suite authored)

## Deliverables

| Artifact | Purpose | Current Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `packages/cli/src/ui/commands/test/setCommand.phase09.test.ts` | Drives `/set` schema resolver behaviour end-to-end | ✅ 13 tests passing |
| `packages/cli/src/ui/hooks/__tests__/useSlashCompletion.set.phase09.test.ts` | Guards hook integration contract (`setCommand.schema`) | ✅ 3 tests passing |

### Coverage Notes

- Property-based coverage: 4 property tests / 13 total resolver assertions (**30.77%**).
- Focus areas:
  1. Literal subcommand selection (`unset`, `modelparam`, literal value keys)
  2. Nested value argument flows (emojifilter, modelparam name/value)
  3. Hint text correctness for direct settings and unset subkeys
  4. Robustness under random provider parameter inventories and arbitrary literal prefixes

### Anti-Fraud Verification

| Check | Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mock theatre | `rg "toHaveBeenCalled" packages/cli/src/ui` | ✅ None detected |
| Reverse testing | `rg "NotYetImplemented" packages/cli/src/ui` | ✅ None in these suites |
| Property ratio ≥ 30% | Manual count (4 / 13) | ✅ Meets requirement |

## Historical Context

When Phase 09 landed the suites were deliberately RED, capturing the missing schema:

1. `setCommand.schema` undefined at hook level.
2. Position tracking mismatches between literal/value transitions.
3. Literal hints leaking into value hint expectations.
4. Tokenization gaps for `/set ` prefixes.

These failures guided the Phase 10 implementation work.

## Current Verification (post-implementation · 2025-10-15)

All specification tests now pass and act as regression coverage:

```bash
cd packages/cli
npx vitest run src/ui/commands/test/setCommand.phase09.test.ts
# 13 passed

npx vitest run src/ui/hooks/__tests__/useSlashCompletion.set.phase09.test.ts
# 3 passed
```

## Success Criteria

- [x] Behavioural tests describing schema expectations.
- [x] Pseudocode references embedded in each scenario.
- [x] Anti-fraud requirements satisfied.
- [x] Property-based coverage ≥ 30%.

## Next Steps

- Extend the suite when new `/set` settings are introduced.
- Keep property tests in sync with additional literal/value branches.

Phase 09 remains the canonical specification for `/set` autocomplete.
