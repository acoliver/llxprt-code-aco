# Phase 10: `/set` Implementation

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20251013-AUTOCOMPLETE.P10`

## Completion Date
2025-10-15

## Summary of Work

| Area | File(s) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Schema definition | `packages/cli/src/ui/commands/setCommand.ts` | Implemented full literal/value tree, async completers for provider params/custom headers, contextual hints, and fallback value branch. |
| Slash completion UX | `packages/cli/src/ui/hooks/useSlashCompletion.tsx` | Reset suggestion state after autocomplete to prevent stale re-insertion and expose branch hints via `activeHint`. |
| Subcommand aliasing | `packages/cli/src/ui/commands/subagentCommand.ts` | Added `altNames: ['create']` so `/subagent create â€¦` reuses the `save` schema flow. |
| Regression tests | `packages/cli/src/ui/commands/test/setCommand.mutation.test.ts` | Expanded coverage for compression bounds, boolean flags, positive-integer guards, truncate-mode enumerations, and malformed JSON handling. |
| Schema contract tests | `packages/cli/src/ui/commands/test/subagentCommand.schema.test.ts` | Switched to real command schema, added alias assertion, and kept resolver helper. |
| Legacy suites | `packages/cli/src/ui/commands/test/subagentCommand.test.ts` | Deprecated legacy completion block (retained placeholder until full migration). |

## Behavioural Outcomes

- `/set` autocomplete now advances from literal keys to value inputs without repeating suggestions.
- `/set modelparam` exposes parameter lists immediately after accepting the literal.
- `/set custom-headers` and other enumerations no longer loop back to the literal suggestion.
- `/subagent create` shares the same schema as `/subagent save`, showing profile suggestions after the agent name.

## Dependencies / Notes

- Actions still rely on existing config services; no persistence changes were required.
- Mutation score improvements are tracked in Phase 10a.
- Keep `useSlashCompletion` reset logic in mind for future slash commands (state reset prevents stale Tab application).
