### Anti-Fraud Checks Completed
- [OK] Tests are genuinely failing with NotImplemented errors (not fake failures)
- [OK] Implementation stub throws correct error messages
- [OK] Test file exists with proper plan markers and requirements mapping
- [OK] All 6 test scenarios are covered: tokenization, literals, value options, async completers, hints, immutability
- [OK] Property-based test included using fast-check
- [OK] Tests properly reference pseudocode lines and requirements

### Test Coverage Analysis
- [OK] REQ-001: Token parsing and immutability tests present
- [OK] REQ-002: Suggestion resolution tests present  
- [OK] REQ-004: Hint computation tests present
- [OK] REQ-005: Async completion and immutability tests present

### Implementation Readiness
- [OK] Schema types defined in `types.ts` with proper plan markers
- [OK] Placeholder handler in `index.ts` correctly throws NotImplemented
- [OK] Test file imports and setup working correctly
- [OK] All tests failing at expected locations with clear error messages

## Manual Verification Checklist
- [x] Failure logs captured and documented above
- [x] Anti-fraud checks confirm tests are legitimately failing
- [x] Execution tracker should be updated to show P04a completed

## Success Criteria Met
- [x] All TDD tests exist and are failing in RED state
- [x] Tests are comprehensive and cover all requirements
- [x] No fake passing tests detected
- [x] Clear path to implementation (Phase 05) identified

## Next Steps
- Proceed to Phase 05: Schema Implementation
- Execute: Implement `createCompletionHandler` function and related utilities
- Tests should turn GREEN as implementation progresses
