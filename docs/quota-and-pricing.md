# LLxprt Code: Quotas and Pricing

LLxprt Code supports multiple AI providers, each with their own pricing and quota structures. A summary of model usage is available through the `/stats` command and presented on exit at the end of a session.

**Important:** Earlier builds surfaced a "Paid Mode" badge in the footer for Gemini sessions. That UI has been removedâ€”LLxprt now stays on the exact model you selected and no longer tries to fall back to flash tiers. To understand whether you're incurring paid traffic, rely on `/stats` or your provider's billing dashboards.

## Provider-Specific Pricing

## Free vs Paid Mode Detection

LLxprt Code attempts to detect when you're in "free" vs "paid" mode:

- **Free Mode:**
  - Google account login with Gemini (limited daily requests)
  - Local models
- **Paid Mode:**
  - Any API key usage (except Google's free tier)
  - All OpenAI and Anthropic usage
  - Most third-party providers

The mode indicator helps you track potential costs, but always verify actual charges with your provider.

## Managing Costs

1. **Monitor Usage:** Use `/stats` regularly to track token usage
2. **Choose Models Wisely:** Smaller models are often cheaper but less capable
3. **Use Local Models:** For development and testing when possible
4. **Set Budgets:** Most providers offer spending limits in their dashboards
