# LLxprt Code Telemetry Guide (Disabled by Default)

**Important:** LLxprt Code has telemetry disabled by default. No data is collected or sent to Google or any external service. The telemetry system is only available for your own local debugging and monitoring if you explicitly enable it.

## Current Status

Telemetry is currently **disabled** in the LLxprt Code codebase. The telemetry initialization code has been commented out to ensure no data collection occurs. If you need telemetry for local debugging:

1. Telemetry must be explicitly enabled in your settings
2. All data stays on your local machine unless you configure an external endpoint
3. No data is ever sent to Google

The telemetry infrastructure is based on the **[OpenTelemetry] (OTEL)** standard, which would allow you to send data to any compatible backend that you control, if you choose to re-enable it.

## Enabling telemetry

You can enable telemetry in multiple ways. Configuration is primarily managed via the [`.gemini/settings.json` file](./cli/configuration.md) and environment variables, but CLI flags can override these settings for a specific session.

### Order of precedence

The following lists the precedence for applying telemetry settings, with items listed higher having greater precedence:

1.  **CLI flags (for `llxprt` command):**
    - `--telemetry` / `--no-telemetry`: Overrides `telemetry.enabled`.
    - `--telemetry-target <local|gcp>`: Overrides `telemetry.target`.
    - `--telemetry-otlp-endpoint <URL>`: Overrides `telemetry.otlpEndpoint`.
    - `--telemetry-log-prompts` / `--no-telemetry-log-prompts`: Overrides `telemetry.logPrompts`.
    - `--telemetry-outfile <path>`: Redirects telemetry output to a file. See [Exporting to a file](#exporting-to-a-file).

1.  **Environment variables:**
    - `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`: Overrides `telemetry.otlpEndpoint`.

1.  **Workspace settings file (`.llxprt/settings.json`):** Values from the `telemetry` object in this project-specific file.

1.  **User settings file (`~/.llxprt/settings.json`):** Values from the `telemetry` object in this global user file.

1.  **Defaults:** applied if not set by any of the above.
    - `telemetry.enabled`: `false`
    - `telemetry.target`: `local`
    - `telemetry.otlpEndpoint`: `http://localhost:4317`
    - `telemetry.logPrompts`: `true`

**Note:** The telemetry scripts (`npm run telemetry`) are provided for development purposes but will not collect any data unless you manually re-enable telemetry in the source code. Even then, the `local` target ensures data stays on your machine, while the `gcp` target would require your own Google Cloud project - LLxprt Code never sends data to Google's telemetry systems.

### Example settings

The following code can be added to your workspace (`.llxprt/settings.json`) or user (`~/.llxprt/settings.json`) settings to enable telemetry for local debugging only:

```json
{
  "telemetry": {
    "enabled": true,
    "target": "local"
  }
}
```

**Important:** Even with these settings, telemetry will not function unless you modify the source code to re-enable it. This is intentional to ensure no accidental data collection.

### Exporting to a file

You can export all telemetry data to a file for local inspection.

To enable file export, use the `--telemetry-outfile` flag with a path to your desired output file. This must be run using `--telemetry-target=local`.

```bash
llxprt --telemetry --telemetry-target=local --telemetry-outfile=/path/to/telemetry.log "your prompt"
```

## Running an OTEL Collector

An OTEL Collector is a service that receives, processes, and exports telemetry data.
The CLI sends data using the OTLP/gRPC protocol.

Learn more about OTEL exporter standard configuration in [documentation][otel-config-docs].

[otel-config-docs]: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/sdk-configuration/otlp-exporter/

### Local

Use the `npm run telemetry -- --target=local` command to set up a local telemetry pipeline for development purposes. Note that telemetry is disabled in the code, so this will not collect any data unless you manually re-enable it. The script installs `otelcol-contrib` (the OpenTelemetry Collector) and `jaeger` (The Jaeger UI for viewing traces) locally. To use it:

1.  **Run the command**:
    Execute the command from the root of the repository:

    ```bash
    npm run telemetry -- --target=local
    ```

    The script will:
    - Download Jaeger and OTEL if needed.
    - Start a local Jaeger instance.
    - Start an OTEL collector configured to receive data from LLxprt Code.
    - Automatically enable telemetry in your workspace settings.
    - On exit, disable telemetry.

1.  **View traces**:
    Open your web browser and navigate to **http://localhost:16686** to access the Jaeger UI. Here you can inspect detailed traces of LLxprt Code operations.

1.  **Inspect logs and metrics**:
    The script redirects the OTEL collector output (which includes logs and metrics) to `~/.llxprt/tmp/<projectHash>/otel/collector.log`. The script will provide links to view and a command to tail your telemetry data (traces, metrics, logs) locally.

1.  **Stop the services**:
    Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the script is running to stop the OTEL Collector and Jaeger services.

### Google Cloud (Not Recommended)

**Important:** LLxprt Code does not send telemetry to Google. The GCP target is only provided if you want to send telemetry to your own Google Cloud project for your own purposes. This is not recommended for normal use.

The `npm run telemetry -- --target=gcp` command sets up a local OpenTelemetry collector that could forward data to your own Google Cloud project. Remember that telemetry is disabled in the code, so no data will be sent unless you manually re-enable it. To use it:

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    - Have a Google Cloud project ID.
    - Export the `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` environment variable to make it available to the OTEL collector.
      ```bash
      export OTLP_GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-project-id"
      ```
    - Authenticate with Google Cloud (e.g., run `gcloud auth application-default login` or ensure `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` is set).
    - Ensure your Google Cloud account/service account has the necessary IAM roles: "Cloud Trace Agent", "Monitoring Metric Writer", and "Logs Writer".

1.  **Run the command**:
    Execute the command from the root of the repository:

    ```bash
    npm run telemetry -- --target=gcp
    ```

    The script will:
    - Download the `otelcol-contrib` binary if needed.
    - Start an OTEL collector configured to receive data from LLxprt Code and export it to your specified Google Cloud project.
    - Automatically enable telemetry in your workspace settings (`.llxprt/settings.json`).
    - Provide direct links to view traces, metrics, and logs in your Google Cloud Console.
    - On exit (Ctrl+C), it will attempt to restore your original telemetry and sandbox settings.

1.  **Run LLxprt Code:**
    In a separate terminal, run your LLxprt Code commands. This generates telemetry data that the collector captures.

1.  **View telemetry in Google Cloud**:
    Use the links provided by the script to navigate to the Google Cloud Console and view your traces, metrics, and logs.

1.  **Inspect local collector logs**:
    The script redirects the local OTEL collector output to `~/.llxprt/tmp/<projectHash>/otel/collector-gcp.log`. The script provides links to view and command to tail your collector logs locally.

1.  **Stop the service**:
    Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the script is running to stop the OTEL Collector.
