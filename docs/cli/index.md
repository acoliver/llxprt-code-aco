## Non-interactive mode

LLxprt Code can be run in a non-interactive mode, which is useful for scripting and automation. In this mode, you pipe input to the CLI, it executes the command, and then it exits.

The following example pipes a command to LLxprt Code from your terminal:

```bash
echo "What is fine tuning?" | gemini
```

LLxprt Code executes the command and prints the output to your terminal. Note that you can achieve the same behavior by using the `--prompt` or `-p` flag. For example:

```bash
gemini -p "What is fine tuning?"
```
